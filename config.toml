I am interested in new trends and technologies related to CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript and Python techniques. As part of my workflow, I love open-source. Aside from that, my interest is in geopolitics, which is the study of the relationship between geography, politics and economics in different parts of the world and is informed by my background in history. As well, I hail from the Bay Area and aligned myself with the cherished franchises of the Oakland Athletics, Golden State Warriors, San Francisco 49ers and San Jose Sharks."
