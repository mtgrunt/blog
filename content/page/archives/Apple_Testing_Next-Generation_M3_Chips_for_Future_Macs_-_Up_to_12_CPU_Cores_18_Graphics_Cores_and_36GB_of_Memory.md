## "Apple Testing Next-Generation M3 Chips for Future Macs: Up to 12 CPU Cores, 18 Graphics Cores and 36GB of Memory."

Apple is preparing for the launch of its next M2 Macs, but it is already testing M3 chips for future devices. The company is ensuring compatibility with its software ecosystem by testing these next-generation Macs with third-party apps. The M3 could help entice customers back to the Mac lineup, as Appleâ€™s Mac business suffered a 31% sales decline last quarter. One version of the M3 in testing has 12 CPU cores, 18 graphics cores, and 36 gigabytes of memory. It is expected to be the base-level version of what will be the M3 Pro coming next year, with two more power-efficient CPU cores and two more graphics cores than the M2 Pro. The 3-nanometer manufacturing process will allow Apple to fit more cores into a small processor. The first Macs with M3 chips are expected to arrive toward the end of the year or early next year, including high-end and low-end MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and iMacs.
