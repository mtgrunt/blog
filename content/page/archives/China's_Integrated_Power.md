## “China's Integrated Power”
#### _04/05/2023_

China’s rise as a global power has significant implications for the international system, and the United States and other Western states are grappling with how to respond. One of China's key strengths is its ability to integrate political, economic, and military power to achieve its goals without resorting to war. The U.S. and other Western states have attempted to respond to China's rise through measures like sanctions, but they lack the political and economic systems to directly integrate such operations.

This analysis also highlights the rapid changes in the nature of warfare, including the rise of irregular warfare, cyber conflict, space operations, joint all-domain operations, precision conventional strike, and the use of artificial intelligence. These developments are shaping the ability to influence, intimidate, deter, and actually fight, and China's success in these areas may dominate the future of military competition. However, this analysis also suggests that many of these developments do not lend themselves easily to the broad force and trend data used in this analysis.

The U.S. has heavily emphasized competition in the Pacific, particularly in the South China Sea, dealing with Taiwan and involving China's growing pressure on South Korea, Japan, and in the Indian Ocean region. However, this focus may have led the U.S. to understate the importance of China's ability to use its economic power on a global basis to conduct the equivalent of gray and white area warfare, its growing capability to put pressure on Central Asian and Indian Ocean states, its growing links to Russia, and its role as a truly global power.

It is still too early to predict exactly how China will improve its nuclear and dual nuclear/conventional warfighting forces and defenses over time, but it seems likely that China will develop a far more advanced capability for mutual assured destruction and focus on conventional wars at low theater levels. This development is redefining the nuclear balance and creating a world in which the risk of nuclear escalation must be evaluated in terms of three states, rather than two.

Finally, international statistics always present major challenges in comparability, particularly when they involve radically different political, military, and economic systems. Many of the data in this analysis are also derived from classified sources and are rounded or adjusted to provide an accurate picture of broad trends. Therefore, it is essential to approach this analysis with caution and to recognize that sources of data and experts often disagree or focus on different metrics, time periods, and methods of comparison. There are also a number of areas where current unclassified estimates are lacking or do not seem credible.

In conclusion, this analysis highlights some of the key challenges that the United States and other Western states face in responding to China's rise as a global power. China's ability to integrate political, economic, and military power is a significant advantage, and the rapid changes in the nature of warfare further complicate the challenges of deterrence, warfighting, defense, and arms control. It is essential to approach this analysis with caution and to recognize the limitations of international statistics in providing an accurate picture of complex and dynamic global trends.
