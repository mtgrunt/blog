## "Framework vs. System76."

System76 and Framework are two laptop manufacturers that offer products with open-source software and hardware that can be customized and upgraded by the user. A user who owns both laptops and has switched back and forth between them for their daily driver has listed out the pros and cons of each.

The Lemur Pro from System76 boasts exceptional battery life and a good selection of I/O ports. The device's magnesium chassis is lightweight, but this has a drawback: it flexes a little more than the user would prefer, and it is a fingerprint magnet. The laptop is not the most user-serviceable, and repairs can be tricky. Parts availability can also be a little iffy. However, System76's support is exceptional, so users can be confident that updates pushed by the manufacturer for Pop!_OS will work.

On the other hand, the Framework laptop's build quality is outstanding. The aluminum chassis feels solid and has no flex. It has modular ports, captive chassis screws, and comes with a tool to service it. In addition, the device is highly customizable; users can change out the keyboard for different layouts, bezels of different colors, and apply skins. It also boasts physical privacy switches for both the camera and microphone individually that do not reset and give a clear indication of whether the devices are enabled or not. However, its battery life is not great, and its USB-A ports may not work reliably in Linux. Although most features work out of the box, it is not as perfect as the Lemur Pro.

In terms of repairability, the Framework laptop is more serviceable than the Lemur Pro. However, the Lemur Pro's battery life is exceptional and almost unmatched. The Framework laptop has a better build quality, but the Lemur Pro's magnesium chassis is lightweight. The Lemur Pro has better support from its manufacturer, but the Framework laptop is more customizable. Ultimately, it depends on the user's needs and preferences, and both laptops have their pros and cons.
