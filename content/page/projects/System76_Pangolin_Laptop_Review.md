The System76 Pangolin laptop is a high-quality Linux-based computer that offers impressive hardware integration. It comes with a Ryzen 7 6800U processor, 32GB of RAM, and up to 16TB of SSD storage. The laptop has a reasonable starting price of $1,299, and it has two drive slots for upgrading in the future. The 15-inch screen is matte, reducing glare and making it easier to read, but some people may find the size a bit large, as it weighs almost 4 pounds. The laptop's build quality is great, and it has a plethora of ports, including a Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI 2.0, a single USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port, three USB-A ports, a 3.5-mm headphone/microphone combo jack, and a full-size SD card reader. The keyboard has a pleasant bounciness to it, with a nice return, and the keys are ever so slightly larger than what most people are used to, which may take some time to adjust to. The AMD Ryzen 7 6800U chip provides excellent performance, with Sysbench scores well above any other Linux laptops tested recently. The Pangolin is not a full-time gaming rig, but for the casual gamer, it can hold its own. Battery life is 8.5 hours, which is excellent for Linux laptops.

System76 has been making Linux laptops longer than most of the big names it now competes against, and it is way ahead of most in most respects. The Pangolin line has been around for two years and is the company's first AMD laptop. The Pangolin is impressively thin at under an inch, despite the plethora of ports that System76 has packed in, including a physical webcam kill switch for privacy. The keyboard has a pleasant bounciness to it, with a nice return, and the keys seem slightly larger than what most people are used to. The AMD Ryzen 7 6800U chip provides impressive performance, and the integrated graphics perform very well compared to previous-generation AMD graphics. Battery life is 8.5 hours, which is excellent for Linux laptops, and the laptop comes with a barrel-style charge cord, but it can also charge over USB-C.
