## "Cloudflare Zero Trust Model."
#### _03/21/2023_ 
 
 Here are the steps to set up a Zero Trust model using Cloudflare:

1. Sign up for a Cloudflare account and create a new project.

2. Go to the "Access" tab in your Cloudflare dashboard and click "Create policy."

3. Name your policy and choose which groups or individuals should have access to your resources.

4. Specify which resources these users should have access to, such as web applications, APIs, or SSH.

5. Choose the authentication method for users to access these resources, such as SSO, LDAP, or two-factor authentication.

6. Create a rule to block all access by default, and then create exceptions for the resources and users that should be allowed.

7. Set up Cloudflare Access to work with your identity provider, if necessary. Cloudflare supports popular providers like Okta, Google, and Microsoft.

8. Test your policy by attempting to access a resource as a user who should have access. If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to access the resource.

9. Monitor your policy and make adjustments as needed. You can view logs of user activity in your Cloudflare dashboard.

That's a basic overview of how to set up a Zero Trust model using Cloudflare. Of course, there may be additional steps or configuration options depending on your specific use case, but this should give you a good starting point.
