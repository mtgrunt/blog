## "Buy or Rent From Your ISP?"

When it comes to internet service, many people focus on the monthly subscription fee and forget about the cost of renting a modem from their Internet Service Provider (ISP). If you're one of these people, you could be missing out on some significant savings.

First of all, it's essential to check your monthly bill for a rental fee, which can range from $5 to $15, depending on your plan and ISP. If you're using a modem/router combo unit, your ISP might add an extra Wi-Fi service fee on top of the rental fee. While some providers offer free modems with certain bundles, you might end up paying more in the long run due to these additional fees.

If your ISP allows you to use your own modem, you could save between $60 and $120 per year by buying one instead of renting it. Even though you'll need to pay upfront for the modem, you'll recoup the cost within a year and start saving $10 a month. Over time, these savings will add up. However, make sure your cable company stops charging you the rental fee since they've been known to "forget" in the past.

Keep in mind that if you're currently using a modem/router combo unit, it's best to keep these devices separate. This means you'll need to purchase a separate wireless router in addition to the modem. Although this might raise the cost of upgrading, it's still worth it in the long run, especially if you need a mesh Wi-Fi system.

While renting a modem might offer some benefits, such as being able to trade it in when it becomes obsolete or stops working, and not having to worry about compatibility or replacing the unit yourself, purchasing your own modem offers more advantages. Some ISPs might not even let you buy your own modem. If you have DSL or fiber, you'll need to rent or purchase special equipment from your ISP since you can't use a cable modem.

If you bundle your home phone service with your internet plan, you'll need a modem with a phone port. However, telephony modems aren't widely available for sale, and renting might be the better option.

It's important to check your ISP's website or contact customer service to see if it's possible to use your own modem. Most ISPs will list compatible modems on their website.

When it comes to choosing the right modem, PCMag doesn't rate cable modems since it's impossible to isolate modem performance from ISP speed. The best modem for you is one that's compatible with your ISP and plan and offers a good balance of price and features. The best modems support DOCSIS 3.0 or 3.1 and are compatible with the major US cable companies, including Spectrum, Comcast, and Cox.

For plans slower than 1 Gigabit, a DOCSIS 3.0 modem is sufficient. The Netgear CM500, Arris Surfboard SB6183, Motorola MB7621, and Netgear CM600 are all good options.

For plans of 1 Gigabit or higher, a DOCSIS 3.1 modem is recommended. The Motorola MB8600, Arris Surfboard SB8200, and Netgear CM1000 are all great choices.

In conclusion, buying your own modem can save you a significant amount of money in the long run, but it's important to check with your ISP first to see if it's allowed. By choosing the right modem for your plan and ISP, you can enjoy faster and more reliable internet service without breaking the bank.
