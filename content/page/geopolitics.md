## "Ukraine's Counteroffensive."
#### _06/14/2023_ 
____
The counteroffensive launched by Ukraine against Russian-backed forces in the southeastern front is facing significant challenges as the real tests lie ahead. Despite the successful retaking of seven villages, Ukrainian troops are still some distance away from Russia's main defensive line, and the bulk of their forces remain on standby. The outcome of the operation will largely depend on attrition, as both sides have suffered losses and will need to manage their resources carefully. There is a risk that Ukrainian forces may endure significant attrition before reaching the Russian defensive lines, making it difficult to breach and exploit it.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has emphasized the importance of Western equipment, such as battle tanks and armored vehicles, in protecting Ukrainian soldiers' lives. Meanwhile, Russia has fortified its defensive positions, including minefields, anti-tank ditches, barricades, and trenches, stretching from western Russia to occupied Crimea. These positions, concentrated in the strategically vital southern region, indicate Ukraine's potential aim to sever Russia's land bridge to Crimea and divide Russian forces.

Ukraine's counteroffensive strategy involves observing where Moscow commits its troops to strengthen its lines and exploiting thinly-defended areas. The goal is to achieve operational and tactical surprise, employing concealment, camouflage, deception, and misinformation. Moscow's strategy in the south aims to maximize Ukrainian casualties before they reach the main Russian line of defenses. Rather than fighting to the death or risking encirclement, the Russian forces will likely retreat to their main defensive line.

Ukraine has been preparing for the counteroffensive for several months, with the creation of 12 armored brigades, nine of which are trained and equipped by Western allies. However, only three of these brigades have been involved in combat operations so far. The main thrusts of the offensive have been near the towns of Orikhiv in Zaporizhzhia region and Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk region. The Ukrainian forces' progress has been significant initially, but there are concerns that the momentum has slowed, and the reasons for this are unclear.

While there have been reports of advances in various areas along the front line, the lack of air power remains a challenge for Ukraine. The country has been seeking F-16 fighter jets from Western allies, but their deployment is still several months away. To maintain operational security, Kyiv has imposed an information blackout, making independent assessments of the battlefield difficult. Russian sources have portrayed the Ukrainian offensive as a failure with heavy losses, showcasing damaged U.S.-made Bradley infantry fighting vehicles and Leopard 2 tanks, which were provided as military aid by the West.

It is still premature to determine the success or failure of the offensive, according to military analysts. The situation remains dynamic, and the outcome will depend on numerous factors, including the ability of Ukrainian forces to overcome the challenges posed by the Russian defensive line, manage attrition, and exploit vulnerabilities in the enemy's defenses. The lack of transparency and reliable information further complicates the assessment of the ongoing conflict.
