## "Fire and Ice: The Ukrainian Conflict, Putin's Expansionism and the Global Power Struggle."

Russian President Vladimir Putin's lies about Ukraine have fueled the ongoing conflict between the two nations. Putin has actively perpetuated myths about Ukraine's historical ties to Russia and its role in Russia's cultural identity, portraying Ukraine as a subordinate nation to Russia. This false narrative has been used to justify Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its continued military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Putin's misinformation campaign has made the world a more dangerous place, as it undermines international norms and fuels tensions between Russia and other nations. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine highlights the devastating consequences of propaganda and the need for truth and accountability in international relations.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is a master at crafting a narrative that serves his political agenda, and his version of events regarding Ukraine has even affected the way Americans view the situation. Putin has created a competitive myth-making environment within his own political system, where historical facts are often ignored in favor of narratives that support his vision of Russia's place in the world. Putin's views on Ukraine are particularly extreme, as he seems to reject the idea of Ukraine as a distinct nation altogether, instead viewing it as a part of the former Soviet Union. This warped perspective has helped justify Russia's military intervention in Ukraine and has made finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict much more difficult. Putin's ability to shape the narrative about Ukraine is a cautionary tale about the power of propaganda in politics and the importance of seeking out the truth in the face of political misinformation.

The differences between Ukraine and Russia began to emerge in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. While both countries had the potential for a positive future, they took divergent paths that shaped their political and social identities. Ukraine embraced pluralism and democracy, while Russia maintained a more authoritarian approach. This divergence was reflected in their attitudes towards their post-Soviet past, with Ukraine seeking to distance itself from its Soviet history and embrace a European identity, while Russia continued to hold on to its Soviet legacy. These differences have been at the root of the ongoing conflict between the two nations, as Ukraine seeks to assert its independence and Russia seeks to maintain its influence over its former Soviet neighbor.

In hindsight, it is clear that policy moves could have been made to avert the 2022 war between Ukraine and Russia. One fundamental point is that the events of 2014 were not taken seriously enough and were not recognized as a fundamental violation of the basic principles of the United Nations Charter. If the international community had treated Russia's annexation of Crimea and military intervention in eastern Ukraine as a war of aggression, it is possible that the conflict could have been resolved without resorting to further military action in 2022. Unfortunately, the failure to address the situation in 2014 allowed tensions to escalate and set the stage for the devastating conflict that unfolded in 2022. This highlights the importance of recognizing and responding appropriately to violations of international law and the need for strong, coordinated action to prevent future conflicts.

What has surprised me about the war in Ukraine is the resilience of the Ukrainian people in the face of Russian aggression and propaganda. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2014 was shocking, but what has been even more surprising is the way that the Ukrainian people have resisted and organized themselves in response. The legacy of the Maidan protests in 2014 has been a powerful force for horizontal societal self-organization and civil society, and this has helped Ukraine to withstand the challenges of the ongoing conflict. Another surprising aspect of the war has been the persistence of Russian propaganda tropes, which have been used to justify the aggression against Ukraine and to try to shape the international narrative around the conflict. Despite these challenges, Ukraine has continued to resist and to fight for its independence and sovereignty, and this is a testament to the strength and determination of the Ukrainian people.

Recent news reports indicate that the Russian government is using email to mobilize citizens for military service. The government has sent out notices informing citizens that they have been conscripted into the military, and if they do not show up for their assignment within twenty days, they will be stripped of their rights as Russian citizens. This includes the ability to register a business, control their real estate, and access loans from banks. The move is part of a wider effort by the Russian government to increase the size and readiness of its military forces, which have been involved in conflicts in Syria and Ukraine in recent years. The use of email to issue conscription orders is a novel approach, and it remains to be seen how effective it will be in achieving the government's goals.

The big blunder of Trump's influence in Ukraine was his administration's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden, in what appeared to be an attempt to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election. This approach reduced Ukraine to a mere instrument in American politics and perpetuated a colonial interpretation of Ukraine as an object rather than a sovereign nation. It also echoed the views of historical figures like Stalin and Hitler who saw Ukraine as a mere pawn in their own political agendas. This blunder not only damaged the relationship between the United States and Ukraine, but it also undermined Ukraine's efforts to assert its independence and sovereignty in the face of ongoing Russian aggression. It was a failure of diplomacy and leadership that will have long-lasting consequences for the region and for U.S. foreign policy more broadly.

Ukrainian history is complex and distinct from that of Russia, with a rich cultural heritage that predates the formation of modern nation-states. The idea of a Ukrainian nation dates back centuries, with a distinct language, culture, and identity that developed over time. The Renaissance and Reformation had a profound impact on Ukrainian society, promoting education, literacy, and artistic expression in ways that were not seen in Moscow. Ukrainian traditions, such as the Cossacks, were characterized by collective decision making and resistance against oppression, reflecting a deep-seated sense of independence and self-determination. The country's long history of interaction with neighboring powers, including Poland and Lithuania, has also shaped its identity and cultural traditions. Today, Ukraine remains a diverse and dynamic country, with a rich history that continues to shape its national identity and its place in the global community.

Winning the war in Ukraine requires a clear theory of victory, one that is grounded in a realistic assessment of the country's strengths and weaknesses, as well as the capabilities of its adversaries. The Ukrainians have proven to be resilient and determined in the face of ongoing Russian aggression, but they need to continue to build up their military and diplomatic capacity, while also engaging in strategic communications to counter Russian propaganda. International support is critical, and NATO's provision of weapons and military assistance is a positive step in the right direction. The deployment of M1 Abrams tanks and other advanced weaponry will help to level the playing field and give Ukraine the tools it needs to defend itself. But ultimately, victory will require a sustained effort and a long-term commitment to building a stable, democratic, and prosperous Ukraine that is able to withstand external pressures and internal challenges.
