The 2022 season for the Seattle Seahawks was a feel-good story, largely due to the impressive performance of Geno Smith, who was named NFL Comeback Player of the Year. Smith, who had been a backup in Seattle for several years, proved himself by completing 399 of 572 passes, leading the league in completion percentage at 69.8%. He threw for 4,282 yards and had 30 touchdowns to 11 interceptions, becoming the only quarterback to take every snap for his team. Smith's outstanding play led the Seahawks to the playoffs, despite being projected to win only 5.5 games.

Playing on a one-year, $3.5 million contract to prove himself, Smith's success earned him a well-deserved 3-year, $75 million contract. His heartwarming story resonated with fans, as he hadn't been a full-time starter since 2014.

During the 2022 season, the Seahawks were a vibes team and fun to watch, scoring many touchdowns from long-distance plays. They recorded the most touchdowns on plays of 10+ yards in the NFL, and their offense was exciting, delivering 29 plays that gained 30+ yards, tied for the 4th most in the league.

Comparing Geno Smith's 2022 stats to Russell Wilson's in 2021, it's evident that Wilson outperformed Smith in various metrics, except completion percentage. However, the Seahawks' offense, led by Wilson in 2021, faced tougher defenses and pass rushes, making the comparison more nuanced.

Looking ahead to 2023, there are some concerns for the Seahawks. They already made significant improvements in their offense, passing more out of heavy sets like 12 personnel, leading to a jump in efficiency from 2021 to 2022. However, with defenses likely adjusting to their play-calling and Geno Smith's tendencies, there's a question of whether the offense can continue to be as effective.

Moreover, Seattle's 2022 success came against an easier schedule of opposing defenses, and they struggled when facing top-10 defenses. In 2023, they are scheduled to play more top-10 run defenses, which might pose challenges for their running game.

The Seahawks' rushing attack, while explosive, struggled with consistency. The team has drafted numerous running backs in recent years, but it remains to be seen if they can find stability in their rushing game.

Furthermore, the impact of outdoor games on quarterback performance cannot be overlooked, and Seattle will play more games outdoors in 2023. Quarterbacks tend to be less efficient when playing outdoors, which might impact Geno Smith's performance.

2022 was a remarkable season for the Seattle Seahawks in terms of passing, with Geno Smith leading the NFL in completion percentage and showcasing significant improvement throughout the year. Smith's contract extension speaks to the confidence the team has in him, and he will continue to be a vital part of the team's passing attack in 2023. However, the Seahawks might face challenges in maintaining Smith's early-season success, especially if opposing defenses study his tendencies and adjust their game plans accordingly. The addition of Jaxon Smith-Njigba in the first round provides a promising option in the receiving corps, complementing DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett. The Seahawks' tight ends have been productive, but the team might adjust its reliance on them with more 11 personnel sets.

In the rushing department, the Seahawks found a gem in Kenneth Walker, who took over after Rashaad Penny's injury and showcased impressive performances. However, Walker's inconsistency in terms of success rate raises some concerns. Seattle drafted Zach Charbonnet to complement Walker, offering a more consistent short-yardage option and improved pass-catching ability. The duo of Walker and Charbonnet could provide the Seahawks with a balanced rushing attack in 2023.

Defensively, the Seahawks made significant moves, acquiring players like Dre'Mont Jones, Jarran Reed, Uchenna Nwosu, and Darrell Taylor to bolster their front line and pass rush. Their secondary also received a boost with the addition of Devon Witherspoon in the first round, adding more physicality to the cornerback group. With Bobby Wagner's return and the signing of Julian Love, the defense looks poised to make an impact in 2023.

Looking at the 2023 draft class, the Seahawks made strategic selections, aiming to address specific needs and add talented players. Devon Witherspoon and Jaxon Smith-Njigba are expected to contribute immediately as starters, with Witherspoon potentially adjusting to Seattle's coverage scheme. Zach Charbonnet's addition might indicate a change in the team's preference for its running game. The Seahawks also targeted players to bolster their defensive line and secondary, providing depth and competition in various positions.

Overall, the Seahawks had a memorable 2022 season, driven by Geno Smith's comeback performance. However, the challenges ahead in 2023, including tougher competition, adjustments from opposing teams and uncertainties in their running game and quarterback play, make it a crucial season for the team's success.
