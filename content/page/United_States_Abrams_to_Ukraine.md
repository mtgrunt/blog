## “United States Abrams to Ukraine.”

The exact timeline for the delivery of the Abrams tanks and the training of Ukrainian troops remains shrouded in ambiguity, with U.S. officials providing only a vague estimate of "many months" for the former. Rather than purchasing new tanks, the U.S. is opting to refurbish older ones, a process that is not only time-consuming but also complex in nature. Furthermore, the delivery of tanks is not simply a matter of sending over a vehicle. Instead, a comprehensive package is required that includes ammunition, maintenance vehicles, and fuel, among other necessities.

To ensure that the tanks are put to good use, the Pentagon is actively developing a training program for Ukrainian troops. Unlike the delivery of tanks, training can commence relatively quickly, even if the precise timeline remains uncertain. The U.S. is committed to ensuring that the Ukrainian military has the knowledge and resources necessary to effectively use and maintain the tanks. This includes not only training in the technical aspects of operating the tanks but also providing guidance on the broader strategic and tactical considerations involved in their use.

Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Doug Bush, is confident that the Ukrainian military has the aptitude and capability to quickly learn how to operate the new tanks. He believes that with sufficient motivation and dedicated access to resources, the training process can be significantly accelerated. However, it is important to balance this desire for speed with the need to ensure that the training is comprehensive and effective. The U.S. must also consider the impact of this effort on other aspects of its military readiness, such as the delivery of equipment to other allies who have also ordered M1 Abrams tanks.
