## “China has to choose one in the Ukraine War.”

Reported to United States officials, China has not provided any military assistance to Russia in the ongoing war in Ukraine as of February 2023. Nevertheless, China is reportedly thinking selling Moscow a range of military hardware, which would be a significant progress in China's geo-strategic calculation and move towards a more pro-Russian stance. The U.S. has informed that such a sift would negatively effect U.S. and China relations and rigorous sanctions are on the board. They relate to the danger of weapons on the battlefields and among the tormenting of nuclear power plants, the disturbance of global economic recovery and the continuing food and energy crisis. China has nonstop to conduct military exercises with Russia but has placed itself as an objective spectator of the conflict, calling for discussion and persuading both to practice restraint. It is sad to see all the wreckage in Ukraine, but it’s not going to stop here and now. More and more, escalation to the war efforts on both side currently.
