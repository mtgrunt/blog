The Houston Texans have been in a sad state in recent years, with their forecasted win totals consistently low. However, there is some cautious optimism surrounding the team in 2023. The optimism is largely attributed to two factors: the addition of a new franchise quarterback and a new head coach who has proven himself in the past. In terms of the head coach, the Texans made some questionable choices in the past, but they now have DeMeco Ryans leading the team. While Ryans may not have been a hot name in the coaching market, he is seen as an upgrade over the previous coaches. The Texans had a revolving door of head coaches and it was clear that they never intended to keep them for more than one season. Ryans and Bobby Slowik will make a great culture there. I suspect that two or three years down the line, it could be an amazing roster. 

The Texans' offense and defense have struggled in recent years, ranking near the bottom of the league in various categories. They had a particularly bad rushing attack, which made it difficult for them to maintain leads and convert on third downs. Their passing attack was also inefficient, with poor accuracy rates and completion rates.
Looking at the Texans' roster, it becomes clear why they have struggled. They have had a significant amount of dead cap space, an aging roster and a limited budget. Despite playing a tough schedule in previous years, the Texans were unable to make much of an impact.

When it comes to the 2023 season, the Texans' forecasted win total is still relatively low. They are only favored in three games and face an uphill battle to improve their record. The offense will need significant improvement, particularly from the receiving options, who will need to outperform expectations. The addition of rookie quarterback C.J. Stroud is seen as an upgrade over the combination of Davis Mills and Kyle Allen, but he will need to elevate the play of the surrounding pass catchers in 2023. 

On the defensive side, the Texans have made some additions to improve their pass rush and secondary. Will Anderson Jr., the third overall pick in the draft is expected to make an immediate impact as an edge rusher. They have also brought in some veterans to solidify the linebacker and secondary positions.

Sheldon Rankins signed a two-year, $9.6 million. He is still a beneficial player, most prized interior defensive lineman. With Maliek Collins, two-year extension, they are production city. Couple with, number three overall pick Will Anderson. Perhaps the best overall player in this yearâ€™s draft.

Overall, while there is some hope for the Texans in 2023, the team still faces significant challenges. The coaching and roster improvements are a step in the right direction, but they will need to overcome their recent struggles and perform at a higher level to see significant improvement in their win total.
