## "49ers Pre-Season."
#### _07/04/2023_ 
____
I'm a fan of San Francisco 49ers and I'm jazzed for 49ers' potential. That said, 49ers have head coach Kyle Shanahan, known for his offensive expertise and innovative play-calling. His offensive schemes can create mismatches and exploit weaknesses in opposing defenses. The 49ers have typically featured a strong running game, employing a combination of talented running backs and an effective offensive line. A strong ground attack can control the clock, wear down defenses and open up opportunities in the passing game. Steve Wilks, the new defensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers, brings a strong presence and a shared vision with the team's leadership. General Manager John Lynch recognized Wilks' willingness and understanding of how the 49ers play the game. The team's success on defense in the previous season made it important to find someone who could maintain the existing culture and approach. Wilks, in his search for his next opportunity, wanted to connect himself with a solid organization that had a great culture and leadership. He saw the 49ers from afar as a team with great things happening and felt that it was a perfect fit for him. Meeting with Jed York, the York family, Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch reinforced his belief in the team's unity and collaboration. Taking on a nearly intact coaching staff and inheriting the league's top-ranked defense, Wilks recognizes the commitment and lack of ego in the room. As the team prepares for the 2023 season, Wilks will have the opportunity to work with his new defensive unit during training camp, ready to bring his presence, vision and aggressive approach to maintain the team's defensive dominance.

Nick Bosa is indeed considered one of the premier edge defenders in the NFL. His combination of speed, strength and technique makes him a disruptive force in opposing backfields. Bosa's selection as the Defensive Player of the Year in 2022 further emphasizes his impact on the field. The addition of Javon Hargrave, a free-agent interior defender, brings a valuable pass-rushing element to the 49ers' defensive line. His presence in the middle can generate pressure on quarterbacks and complement the edge rushers like Bosa. While Arik Armstead had a down season in terms of grading, he is a talented player who should still have the potential to make significant contributions. At 29 years old, Armstead possesses experience and physical tools that can make him an effective part of the defensive line rotation. Drake Jackson, entering his second year, is expected to make a leap in his development. Young players often show improvement in their sophomore seasons as they become more comfortable with the speed and demands of the NFL. If Jackson can make strides in his game, it will further bolster the 49ers' pass rush. Overall, with Nick Bosa leading the way and the additions of Javon Hargrave and the potential growth of players like Arik Armstead and Drake Jackson, the 49ers' defensive line has the potential to be a formidable unit capable of wreaking havoc in the opponent's backfield.

The 49ers' secondary has sometimes been a concern in recent years. If the cornerback position is not solidified or lacks depth, it could be exploited by opposing quarterbacks and receivers. The 49ers' cornerback situation heading into training camp seems to be a mix of established players and some potential dark horses. Charvarius Ward was signed as a free agent last offseason and likely enters camp as one of the presumed starting outside cornerbacks. Deommodore Lenoir was a rookie who was drafted by the 49ers. He will be a starter and he has shown promise. Isaiah Oliver was signed by the 49ers this offseason after spending his first four seasons with the Atlanta Falcons. He brings experience to the cornerback group and will likely be in the nickel slot. Ambry Thomas was drafted by the 49ers in the third round of the 2021 NFL Draft. He is a young player with potential and will be looking to make an impact during training camp. Samuel Womack III, AJ Parker, Qwuantrezz Knight and Tre Swilling: These players are either undrafted rookies or players with limited experience. They will have an uphill battle to earn a roster spot or significant playing time but could potentially surprise during camp. With Emmanuel Moseley departing in free agency, the cornerback position becomes more uncertain beyond the presumed starters. The coaching staff will need to evaluate the talent they have and make decisions based on performance during training camp and the preseason games. It's possible that the 49ers could still explore outside options if they feel the need to upgrade the position before the regular season begins.

If the offensive line lacks talent or struggles with injuries, it can hinder the team's ability to protect the quarterback and establish a strong running game. An ineffective offensive line can limit the offense's productivity. San Francisco 49ers offensive-line as follows; starters, Trent Williams, Colton McKivitz, Spencer Burford, Aaron Banks and Jake Brendel. Backup, Jaylon Moore, Matt Pryor, Leroy Watson, Jon Feliciano, Nick Zakelj, Jason Poe, Keith Ismael, Alfredo Gutierrez, Ilm Manning, Joey Fisher and Corey Luciano. 49ers need more money on the O-line. The significance of strong line play in football cannot be overstated and the 49ers' top-five units on both sides of the ball bode well for their success as they enter the playoff stage. This formidable presence in the trenches positions the 49ers favorably for the challenges that lie ahead in the postseason.

The 2023 NFL season could see the San Francisco 49ers adopt a more aggressive offensive approach, driven by three key factors. Firstly, having versatile star running back Christian McCaffrey available from the start of the season, along with the talents of tight end George Kittle and receivers Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk, provides the offense with a strong foundation. Secondly, head coach Kyle Shanahan has shown faith in quarterback Brock Purdy, who stepped into the lineup as a rookie. The organization believes Purdy is both the present and future of the club, suggesting a willingness to open up the offense and capitalize on his accuracy and playmaking ability. This confidence in Purdy could prompt Shanahan to be more aggressive in his play-calling. Lastly, the departure of reliable veteran kicker Robbie Gould means the 49ers can no longer rely on automatic points once they reach the 30-yard line. Gould's consistent performance in converting field goals had often influenced the team's decision-making in favor of kicking, rather than going for it on fourth-and-short. With the uncertainty surrounding rookie kicker Jake Moody, the offense might be tasked with keeping drives alive through more fourth-down attempts.

The presence of McCaffrey, a multi-dimensional threat, combined with Purdy's decision-making and accuracy, make the offense a suitable candidate for a more aggressive approach. McCaffrey's versatility creates matchup problems, while Purdy's impact on the offense was evident when he took over as the team's quarterback in Week 13 of the previous season. The offense significantly improved during that stretch, averaging 33.5 points per game in the final six regular-season games. If Purdy's recovery from surgery goes well, he is expected to be the starting quarterback, having earned Shanahan's confidence. This continuity and trust in Purdy's abilities should carry over into the upcoming season, providing further motivation for the offense to adopt a more aggressive mindset. Overall, with the combination of talented playmakers, Shanahan's confidence in Brock Purdy, the 49ers have the ingredients for a more aggressive offensive approach, potentially making the offense the team's strength in the 2023 season.
