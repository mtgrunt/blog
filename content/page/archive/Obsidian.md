## "Rust and Obsidian.md"  
#### _08/01/2023_   
____
Obsidian.md is a popular note-taking application known for its capabilities in knowledge organization and management. The "No Boilerplate" channel focuses on creating content related to programming and coding, the code for the talks is stored in the "scripts/" directory.

To create the talks, utilizes Obsidian.md in combination with the advanced-slides plugin. This plugin allows for the creation of presentation slides with advanced features. The process involves taking each slide's content, capturing a screenshot of it and then combining it with the corresponding audio using the audio editing software reaper.fm. This approach enables the creation of engaging and informative talks with both visual and auditory components.

The  has a strong foundation in Rust programming language, and they have honed their skills through various resources. One of the primary sources they mention is "The Book" for Rust, which is the official Rust programming language documentation. It provides comprehensive guidance and explanations on the language's features and concepts.

Additionally, has found valuable content on "fasterthanli.me," starting with an article titled "Understanding Rust Futures by Going Way Too Deep." This website likely contains in-depth articles and tutorials related to Rust programming.

Furthermore, "Rust By Example," which follows the same chapter ordering as "The Book." This resource provides practical examples that demonstrate various Rust features and programming techniques in an easy-to-understand manner.

It was engaged in code katas using the "Rustlings" repository. Code katas involve practicing programming by fixing small, failing tests. This interactive and hands-on approach to learning has likely contributed to write Rust code more effectively.

By combining these resources with the powerful note-taking features of Obsidian.md, enables them to create engaging talks on the "No Boilerplate" channel. Their talks are likely well-structured, informative and supported by a strong foundation in Rust programming.
