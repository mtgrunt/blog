The New Orleans Saints had a challenging 2022 season, finishing with a record of 7-10. Through Week 14, they were 4-9 and last in the NFC South, with only a few teams having worse records at that point in the season. The Saints' performance in one-score games was not particularly impressive, as they had a 3-3 record in such games and a 39% against-the-spread rate, which ranked ninth-worst in the league.

One notable aspect of the Saints' offensive strategy in recent years has been their limited use of 3+ receivers and 11 personnel on early downs. In both 2021 and 2022, they ranked among the lowest in the league in these categories. This reduction in 11 personnel was partly due to injuries in their receiver corps, which was one of the most injured units in the league during those years. Derek Carr has the potential to light up the scoreboard; he could be renewal. Chris Olave was fire in his rookie season. He caught 72/119 for 1,042 yards. A very precise goal to accomplish year two of Olave and the Saints.

The Saints struggled with rushing efficiency in recent seasons, ranking among the worst in the league. In 2022, they ranked 10th-worst in rushing efficiency, averaging only 4.0 yards per carry. Running back Alvin Kamara faced challenges on the ground, particularly due to the offensive scheme that limited his opportunities with 3+ receivers on the field. Only 38% of his early down attempts came in such situations, ranking 27th in the NFL. 

Defensively, the Saints had significant issues with their defensive line in 2022. They finished last in ESPN's pass rush win rate and 25th in run stop win rate. These struggles contributed to their overall defensive performance. However, there is optimism for improvement, as the Saints made efforts to address their front seven in the 2023 draft and through free agency.

Head coach Dennis Allen faced criticism for his decision-making, particularly regarding punting on fourth-and-one from their own territory. His conservative approach limited the team's opportunities to extend drives and potentially gain an advantage in games. Additionally, Allen's offensive play-calling lacked the use of pre-snap motion and play action, which are known to improve pass success rates and yards per attempt.

The offensive line for the Saints had difficulties with injuries, as no offensive lineman appeared in all 17 games. The starters missed significant playing time, hampering the cohesion and stability of the unit. The offensive line's performance is crucial for the success of the offense, and the Saints will need their starters to stay healthy in the upcoming season.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, the Saints' schedule is projected to be one of the easiest in the league. This favorable schedule could provide an opportunity for the team to improve from their previous year's record. However, the team's success will largely depend on the evolution of head coach Dennis Allen's approach and the performance of key players like Alvin Kamara, Chris Olave, and the newly added defensive players, such as Bryan Bresee and Khalen Saunders.

Overall, the New Orleans Saints faced challenges in the 2022 season, but there are potential areas of improvement in their offensive strategy, rushing efficiency, defensive line performance, and coaching decisions. The 2023 season holds promise for the team with an easier schedule and key additions to the roster. However, the team will need to address their weaknesses and stay healthy to reach their projected 9-win forecast and potentially exceed expectations.
