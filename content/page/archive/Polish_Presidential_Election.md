## "2024 Polish Presidential Election."

The political landscape in Poland appears to be shifting dramatically as opposition leader Donald Tusk claimed victory in Sunday's parliamentary election. The exit poll results, indicating a stunning 72.9% in favor of opposition parties. This development heralds the beginning of a new era for Poland, according to Tusk. Donald Tusk's promise to normalize EU relations suggests a potential shift in Poland's foreign policy.
  
The incumbent Law and Justice party (PiS), known for its nationalist stance and frequent clashes with the European Union, is set to remain the largest party but is losing its parliamentary majority. The exit polls indicate that PiS has secured 198 seats out of the 460-lawmaker legislature, while the liberal opposition bloc has 248 seats. This result signifies a significant setback for PiS rule and opens the door for possible coalition negotiations.
  
Poland now faces a period of uncertainty, with the need for coalition negotiations before a new government can take power. The president, Andrzej Duda, who is allied with PiS, has 30 days from the election to convene the first session of the new parliament and 14 days to nominate a candidate for prime minister. Duda's choice is likely to come from the winning party, which might be PiS or another nominee who could assemble a majority.
  
The nominee for prime minister will then have an additional 14 days to request and win a parliamentary vote of confidence, which may extend the process into mid-December. To secure confidence, the nominee must obtain an absolute majority in the lower house of parliament, the Sejm, with at least 230 lawmakers supporting them.
  
If the initial nominee fails to win the vote of confidence, the process returns to the Sejm for another 14 days, during which lawmakers can nominate a different candidate for prime minister. This candidate, like the first, will need an absolute majority in the Sejm to secure confidence.
  
Should this second attempt also fail, the president will have another 14 days to pick a third candidate for prime minister and parliament will have 14 days to vote. In this scenario, a simple majority would suffice to secure confidence, potentially resulting in a minority government.
  
This intricate process could extend into the second half of January, and if no cabinet is agreed upon by then, the president would be compelled to call another parliamentary election. The unfolding political situation in Poland underscores the significance of the parliamentary election and the complex path to forming a new government in the country.
