The Los Angeles Chargers had a highly talented roster on both offense and defense during the 2022 season. They improved significantly from the previous year, winning 9 games despite having a bottom-10 defense in 2021. Despite this improvement, there were concerns about their coaching, which was seen as the only thing holding them back from a Super Bowl appearance.

In the previous year, the coaching staff did not optimize their star quarterback Justin Herbert's abilities, often limiting his target depth and play-action options. Joe Lombardi, the offensive coordinator, failed to increase Herbert's target depth, which was a cause of frustration for fans and analysts. The coaching staff's decision-making was questionable, and they did not effectively utilize analytics to adjust their strategies during the season.

During the 2022 season, there were further concerns about Herbert's target depth on early downs, which decreased to a surprisingly low average of 5.60 air yards per attempt. It was speculated that Herbert's injuries, particularly his rib injury, might have played a role, but the correlation was not definitive. In games where star receiver Keenan Allen was absent, the Chargers resorted to an RB-heavy passing attack, which indicated coaching decisions rather than Herbert's injuries as the reason for the low target depth.

Furthermore, the Chargers' play-action game also suffered, with Herbert's target depth on early down play-action ranked among the lowest in the league. The coaching staff did not make necessary adjustments to improve this aspect of their offense.

Another area of concern was the usage of 12 personnel (one running back and two tight ends) without play action. Passing from 12 personnel without play action proved to be inefficient, yet the Chargers did not adjust their approach in 2022, continuing to pass from 12 personnel without play action at a higher rate than the previous year.

Herbert's performance on third downs and when under pressure also regressed from his outstanding 2020 season. Although he still performed well in these situations, it was evident that the Chargers needed to find ways to avoid third downs, as they were the downs where most pressure was likely to come.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, there is hope that the hiring of Kellen Moore as the new offensive coordinator will improve the offensive strategy significantly. The team's health, particularly in the wide receiver position and offensive line, will also be crucial for their success. The Chargers' defense saw improvements thanks to offseason spending, but their overall performance on early downs and EPA/snap remained relatively low.

In 2022, the Los Angeles Chargers faced numerous challenges, especially in their passing game. Star quarterback Justin Herbert battled through injuries, including a chest fracture and a torn labrum, affecting his performance. Despite these setbacks, Herbert managed to rank 16th in expected points added per dropback, but his yards per pass attempt dropped to 6.8, placing him 26th in the league. The receiving corps struggled with injuries, as Keenan Allen and Mike Williams missed significant time, resulting in Austin Ekeler leading the team in targets. However, the outlook for 2023 seems promising with the addition of receivers Quentin Johnston and Derius Davis in the draft, providing depth and team speed.

In 2022, the Chargers' rushing game was subpar, ranking among the worst in the league. They finished 27th in yards per carry, 24th in runs that gained 10 or more yards, and 27th in runs that failed to gain yardage. Austin Ekeler, the primary running back, carried most of the workload, but the team lacked substantial depth behind him. The organization has expressed the need to alleviate Ekeler's workload, but they did not make any significant moves to bolster the running back depth chart for the upcoming 2023 season.

Defensively, the Chargers made some improvements by bringing in players like Sebastian Joseph-Day, who helped improve the run defense. However, overall, the team's run defense still ranked last in the league in expected points added per play against the run. The pass rush duo of Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack was expected to excel, but injuries and limited playing time hindered their full potential. The secondary also faced challenges, with cornerback J.C. Jackson struggling before his injury. Asante Samuel Jr. and Michael Davis had their ups and downs in coverage but showed potential.

The 2023 draft class for the Chargers focused on addressing future needs and depth. Quentin Johnston, the first-round pick, is a receiver known for his production after the catch, but he will need to improve his downfield separation skills. Tuli Tuipulotu, the second-round pick, is a versatile defensive player best suited for the edge, offering depth behind Bosa and Mack. Daiyon Henley, the third-round pick, is a promising linebacker who will provide support to Kenneth Murray and Eric Kendricks, with potential to take on a starting role in the future. The Chargers also added return specialist Derius Davis and offensive lineman Jordan McFadden, among others to provide depth and competition.

In conclusion, the Los Angeles Chargers' roster talent was undeniable in 2022, but their coaching decisions held them back from reaching their full potential. With Kellen Moore as the new offensive coordinator and a healthy roster, there is optimism for the 2023 season, but the team must continue to address coaching issues and make necessary adjustments to maximize their performance.
