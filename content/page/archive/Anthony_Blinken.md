## "Blinken's China Visit."

The story discusses the criticism faced by Anthony Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State, as he plans to visit China in an attempt to reset relations. Critics from both the left and the right have differing views on this visit. On the left, there are concerns about engaging with a country considered a trade foe, while the right questions why Blinken is visiting Beijing when it is Beijing's actions that have strained the relationship. Although not taking a position on the matter, the story highlights three important points.

Firstly, China, under Chairman Xi Jinping, has developed into a cult of personality, with Jinping at the center of power. This environment of centralized decision-making has resulted in catastrophic outcomes, as there is a lack of capable advisors and bureaucrats who can effectively interpret and implement the government's directives. This absence of a diplomatic position makes it challenging to have normal diplomatic relations with China, as there is no cadre of individuals to translate the leadership's broad guidance into daily actions.

Secondly, the story draws a parallel between China's current situation and the criticism faced by Bill Clinton during his presidency for neglecting Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union. The narrative suggests that the U.S. should not ignore China's decline and instead prepare for a post-China world. Managing the decline of a superpower requires engagement, even if it does not yield immediate results. Ignoring a declining superpower limits options for effectively managing the situation.

Lastly, intelligence gathering becomes a crucial aspect of engaging with China. Unlike leaders like Trump or Putin, Chairman Xi has a tightly controlled inner circle, making it difficult to gather intelligence through traditional means. The lack of vulnerability within Xi's circle means that engaging directly at the highest level possible, such as Blinken's visit, becomes one of the few ways to gain insights into China's top leadership and understand the country's dynamics.

In conclusion, while Blinken's trip to China is subject to criticism from various perspectives, the story highlights the importance of three key factors. The cult of personality surrounding Chairman Xi Jinping: he is on his own about anything important. Realize that quickly. The need to prepare for a post-China world and manage its decline and the significance of intelligence gathering in a country with limited transparency at the top. These elements contribute to the complexity of U.S.-China relations and underscore the importance of engaging with China despite the challenges.
