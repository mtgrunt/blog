Apple's new AR/VR headset is a first-generation device that combines augmented reality and virtual reality. It features a range of cameras and sensors and is a standalone computer with its own M2 Chip and Wi-Fi connection. The headset has a 4K micro OLED display for each eye and a set of speakers above each ear. It also includes a dedicated R1 chip for real-time processing. The price starts at $3,500, and it is expected to be available for sale early next year.

The headset works by using sensors to detect the user's hands, eyes, and voice for control. There are no separate controllers for this device, as users control it entirely through hand gestures, eye movements, and voice commands. The extensive array of sensors on the headset allows for accurate tracking of hand movements and eye tracking. The eye tracking feature is particularly impressive, as it instantly highlights and selects the user's focus point, regardless of the size or location of the target. To select something, users simply touch their fingers together.

Before using the headset, there is a setup process that involves scanning the user's face with the true depth camera on an iPhone. This creates a custom cutout for the headset, ensuring a personalized fit. The headset itself is well-built, with metal and glass materials and breathable fabric on the back. The eye tracking capability stands out as a standout feature, allowing users to navigate the user interface effortlessly by just looking at items and using hand gestures.

The headset's user interface relies on eye tracking and hand gestures for interaction. The sensors on the outside of the headset do an impressive job of tracking hand movements, making it easy to interact with objects without the need for external controllers. There are also text boxes for typing, and users can either look at the letters or use voice input for text entry. The headset's microphone allows for voice commands, and it features optic ID, which uses eye recognition as a biometric identification method.

The headset also has a unique feature called "2-way pass-through." It includes an OLED screen facing outward, creating the illusion of transparency when the user looks at it. This pass-through mode allows users to see their surroundings without removing the headset. The pass-through is of high quality, with stereo, color, and real-time capabilities. Additionally, the headset can be used for computing purposes, acting as its own computer with web browsing and other functionalities. It can also mirror a Mac's display and be used with a Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad.

While the headset's software is currently limited to Apple's own apps, the early announcement of the device gives developers time to create their own apps for it. The headset's computing capabilities, connectivity features (including messaging and FaceTime), and content consumption potential make it a versatile device with the potential for various applications. With Apple's entry into the AR/VR market, the industry is expected to see significant growth in terms of content creation and user engagement.
