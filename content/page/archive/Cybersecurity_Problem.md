## "Escalating Cybersecurity Challenges."
#### _06/25/2023_ 
____
Increasing sophistication of hackers: Hackers have become highly skilled at emulating legitimate user behavior and application behavior, making it challenging for traditional security measures to detect their activities. This includes mimicking email communication, website appearances and running processes that appear harmless at first glance.

Incomplete security approach: Many organizations focus on specific aspects of cybersecurity, such as email security or endpoint detection and response (EDR), but this narrow focus leaves significant gaps in overall security. By only monitoring one area, organizations miss the bigger picture and fail to identify the patterns that indicate a cyber attack.

Tool sprawl and misconfiguration: Over the years, organizations have accumulated a multitude of security tools, resulting in tool sprawl. However, having numerous tools doesn't guarantee effective protection if they are not properly deployed and configured. Security professionals often struggle with correctly deploying and managing their security solutions, leading to vulnerabilities and inadequate protection.

Limited effectiveness of best-of-breed solutions: Despite the widespread deployment of state-of-the-art security solutions like EDR, next-generation firewalls, and advanced identity systems, the frequency and severity of ransomware attacks continue to rise. Relying solely on individual best-of-breed solutions does not provide comprehensive protection against evolving threats.

Need for a platform approach: To address the shortcomings of fragmented security measures, a shift towards a platform approach is necessary. A security platform combines multiple security tools and solutions, enabling a holistic view of an organization's security posture. By integrating data from various domains and analyzing patterns across different security layers, a platform approach enhances the overall efficacy of cybersecurity.

The importance of visibility and context: With attackers adept at mimicking legitimate behavior, relying on logs or summary data alone is insufficient. Organizations require real-time visibility into every aspect of their network, from packet-level data to process behavior, to identify malicious activities accurately. The ability to correlate events across different domains provides context and enables the detection of complex attack patterns that may go unnoticed with individual security solutions.
