## “Ukraine Waits.”

Hello again. Waiting in the wings for other people to make a decision can be frustrating, especially when it comes to important matters like NATO membership and the case of Ukraine. The NATO alliance is a unique multilateral security agreement where countries have unanimously agreed to protect each other. Unlike most bilateral agreements throughout history, NATO's Article 5 legally binds its members to defend one another. However, theory and practice can differ.

Ukraine's desire to join NATO has been a topic of discussion. While they have demonstrated their capabilities in facing off against Russia, the reality is that Ukraine faces significant obstacles to joining NATO anytime soon. One major requirement for NATO membership is to have no border disputes with neighboring countries. Unfortunately, Ukraine currently has such disputes and until they are resolved, joining NATO remains off the table. This has been the case for other countries in the past.

Another crucial aspect to consider is that NATO was created to keep Russia at arm's length, but it is not eager to engage in a direct conflict with a nuclear power. As long as hostilities continue between Ukraine and Russia, NATO countries will not want to directly involve themselves. While NATO may support Ukraine in various ways, invoking Article 5 and entering a state of general war is not a desirable outcome. Ukraine needs to work with the resources and support available to them, as the full protection of NATO is still years away.

Even if Russia were to be completely defeated tomorrow and its ability to wage war removed, the process of NATO accession for its 30-plus members would take another four or five years. This demonstrates that NATO membership is not an immediate solution for Ukraine. They must navigate their current challenges and seek alternatives to ensure their security and stability in the meantime. NATO can provide assistance, but the full extent of its guarantees and membership is a long-term goal that requires several prerequisites to be met.

In conclusion, waiting for decisions in matters like NATO membership can be frustrating. Ukraine's desire to join NATO faces significant obstacles, including unresolved border disputes and NATO's cautious approach towards engaging in conflicts with nuclear powers. While Ukraine can receive support from NATO in various ways, full membership and the invocation of Article 5 guarantees are distant prospects that require time, resolution of disputes and strategic considerations. In the interim, Ukraine must rely on its own efforts and available assistance to address its security needs. Cheerio.
