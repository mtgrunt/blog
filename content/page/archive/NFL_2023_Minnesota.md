The 2022 season was a roller coaster for the Minnesota Vikings. They had several factors work in their favor, such as improved turnover margin and sack margin, better fumble luck, and improved field goal luck. However, their performance in close games was lacking, as they won only 6 out of 14 games decided by one score. Ultimately, they finished the season with an 8-9 record, falling short of their expectations and missing the playoffs.

Heading into the 2022 season, there was hope among fans due to the team's coaching change. Mike Zimmer was replaced by Kevin O'Connell, bringing a fresh perspective to the team. However, there were concerns about whether the Vikings could replicate their success in the various factors that favored them in the previous season.

Despite the doubts, many people, including the author, supported the Vikings in 2022. However, their performance surpassed all expectations. The team finished with a remarkable 13-4 record, which was their best since signing Kirk Cousins. Yet, when examining their performance in the first three quarters of games, it becomes clear that they shouldn't have won as many games as they did.

The Vikings trailed by over 70 combined points entering the fourth quarter in every single game in 2022. They ranked 30th in point differential during the first three quarters of games. However, their fourth-quarter performances were exceptional, with the team scoring 169 points in that period alone. This allowed them to achieve an 11-0 record in games decided by one score, which was the best mark in history.

Despite their impressive record, the author argues that the Vikings were not a great team. Kirk Cousins, the team's quarterback, had his worst season for Minnesota, posting lower completion percentages, yards per attempt, and touchdown percentages compared to previous years. He struggled in stable quarterback metrics, regressed on key performance indicators, and faced difficulties against both strong and weak pass defenses.

The Vikings heavily relied on the passing game, using more 11 personnel formations in 2022. However, their running game remained a significant concern. Despite facing lighter defensive boxes, their running backs ranked poorly in EPA/rush and yards before contact per rush. The offensive line had some injury issues, and both guard positions were problematic. Additionally, the team made a decision to move on from Dalvin Cook, further adding uncertainty to the running back position.

Despite Kirk Cousins having one of his worst seasons in terms of efficiency, he still performed at an average level compared to other quarterbacks. He enters the 2023 season under contract for just one year, with his 2024-2025 years automatically voided. The team restructured his contract to create cap space for this offseason.

Justin Jefferson had a phenomenal 2022 season, leading the league in catches and receiving yards. T.J. Hockenson emerged as the second receiving option after being acquired during the season. Jordan Addison, the team's first-round pick, is expected to step into the WR2 role. Adam Thielen, who was second in routes run in 2022, is no longer on the roster. K.J. Osborn also showed promise in the latter part of the season.

Dalvin Cook had a down year in 2022, averaging a career-low 4.4 yards per carry. The team released Cook in June, putting Alexander Mattison at the forefront of the backfield. However, Mattison has been lackluster in terms of efficiency. The team has inexperienced options behind Mattison, including Ty Chandler, DeWayne McBride, and Kene Nwangwu.

Harrison Phillips was the team's best run defender, and the interior defensive line has some depth behind him. Danielle Hunter and Za'Darius Smith provided solid pass rushing, but there is a lack of depth in that area. Jordan Hicks was a solid run defender but struggled in coverage. The cornerback position saw significant changes, with Andrew Booth, a 2022 second-round pick, expected to be ready for training camp. Byron Murphy joined the team from the Cardinals, and rookies Mekhi Blackmon and Jay Ward were added in the draft. Safety Harrison Smith remains a fixture, but his impact has diminished. Lewis Cine, the team's first-round pick in 2022, suffered a season-ending injury.

Jordan Addison, the team's first-round pick, is expected to step into a starting role. Mekhi Blackmon, a third-round pick, showed promise in college and could challenge for a starting job. Jay Ward, a fourth-round pick, adds depth and versatility to the secondary. Jaquelin Roy, a fifth-round pick, is a nose tackle who will contribute by occupying space. Jaren Hall, a fifth-round pick, will provide competition at the quarterback position. DeWayne McBride, a seventh-round pick, joins a crowded backfield and will need time to develop. The draft focused on addressing immediate needs, but with only six picks, there is little room for error.

In summary, the Minnesota Vikings exceeded expectations in the 2022 season, posting a 13-4 record despite trailing by significant margins in the first three quarters of games. However, the author argues that their success was largely due to fourth-quarter comebacks and one-score game victories, rather than being a genuinely great team. Concerns surround Kirk Cousins' performance, the running game, and the offensive line heading into the 2023 season.
