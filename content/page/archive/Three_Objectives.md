## "Three Objectives"

In the current state of affairs in Ukraine, a series of unsettling events has unfolded as Russia initiated a wave of drone strikes on the city of Kiev. Earlier this morning, sending reverberations of blasts echoing through the Ukrainian capital. This ominous development occurs against the backdrop of a prolonged military operation, now on its 564th day. Before that, President Vladimir Putin, initially labeled a "10-day special military operation" on Ukraine.

These drone attacks are accompanied by unconfirmed reports of retaliatory drone strikes launched by Ukraine into Crimea, although no casualties have been reported thus far. Ukrainian authorities have asserted that they successfully intercepted and downed all drones directed at their territory.

Three objectives for the Ukraine military offensives. One is Bakhmut, it's a massacre over there in the East. Second aim is around Avdiivka, that region is important to Ukraine for military factors. The third is Robotyne to Tokmak to Melitopol. I think it's very out of reach to go to Melitopol this year, but Tokmak is in Ukraine's plan for this year. End of the day, you want to manage the battles strategically.

During a recent press conference held in the United States, General Miley, the head of the U.S. armed forces, and Admiral Radican, the head of the British Armed Forces, provided insights into the ongoing situation on the ground. When asked about the progress of Ukraine's summer offensive against Russia, General Miley remained cautious, stating that it was "too early" to assess its success. He emphasized the substantial disparity between military planning on paper and the unpredictable reality unfolding on the battlefield.

In contrast, Admiral Radican offered a more optimistic perspective. He argued that when viewed within a broader context, it becomes evident that Ukraine is gaining the upper hand in this conflict. He alluded to Russia's precarious position, suggesting that the country is resorting to unconventional measures and forging complex relationships out of necessity. An illustrative example of this desperation is Russia's engagement with North Korea, as witnessed in Defense Minister Shoigu's visit to Pyongyang in July. Notably, Kim Jong-un, North Korea's leader, has expressed intentions to visit Moscow to finalize a deal for supplying weapons to Russia. Such developments underscore Russia's military vulnerability and Ukraine's gradual ascendancy in this protracted conflict.
