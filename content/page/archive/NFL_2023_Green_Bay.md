Green Bay Packers faced unexpected issues during the 2022 season. Aaron Rodgers, known for his low interception rate, threw more interceptions than in the previous years. He struggled when unpressured and had a significant drop in efficiency compared to the previous seasons. Furthermore, Rodgers adopted a style of passing attack that involved a high percentage of short and quick passes, targeting running backs frequently.

In 2022, the Green Bay Packers had one of the highest cash spends in the NFL, with a roster cost of $280 million, ranking them second in the league. However, in 2023, their spending has significantly decreased, with a cash spend of only $194 million as of June. This drop in spending is primarily due to the dead cap for Aaron Rodgers, amounting to $57 million, which ranks third in the league. Overall, the Packers' offense has gone from being the ninth most expensive in 2022 to the least expensive in 2023, while their defense has dropped from the second most expensive to the 18th.

With the departure of several key players, including Aaron Rodgers, Allen Lazard, Randall Cobb, Robert Tonyan, Jarran Reed, and Dean Lowry, the Packers have made minimal moves in free agency. Their most notable signing has been long snapper Matthew Orzech from the Rams on a modest 3-year, $3.7 million deal. This significant decrease in spending and lack of notable acquisitions have lowered expectations for the Packers in the upcoming season. Their win total projection has dropped from 11 to just 7.5 games, and they are predicted to finish last in their division, a stark contrast to their previous dominance in the division over the past decade.

The Green Bay Packers' draft class in 2023 featured a mix of players with different skill sets. First-round pick Lukas Van Ness is a prototypical edge rusher who fits the profile of Packers' defenders Preston Smith and Rashan Gary. Van Ness showed versatility in college, performing well both on the edge and on the interior. However, it remains to be seen how defensive coordinator Joe Barry will utilize his skills.

Luke Musgrave, the second-round pick, is a traditional in-line tight end known for his blocking abilities. He will compete for the starting job and could earn it based on his blocking prowess. Tucker Kraft, the third-round pick, is a more dynamic athlete and offers upside as a pass catcher, but his developing blocking skills might limit his immediate playing time.

Jayden Reed, selected in the second round, adds depth to the receiving corps. Although he lacks ideal size and athleticism, Reed has the potential to contribute. Colby Wooden and Karl Brooks, picked in the fourth and sixth rounds, respectively, played on the edge in college but will likely transition to the interior in Green Bay.

With Aaron Rodgers leaving, the Packers are now relying on Jordan Love, a player with limited playing time and little to go on in terms of projecting his performance. Reports surrounding Love were more positive last season, leading the Packers to feel comfortable letting Rodgers go. However, it remains to be seen how Love will handle the starting role. The depth chart behind Love consists of fifth-round rookie Sean Clifford and Danny Etling.

The Packers had a young pass-catching corps in 2022, with players like Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs making contributions. Watson had a strong stretch of games, while Doubs showed promise as a rookie. The Packers added Jayden Reed, Luke Musgrave and Tucker Kraft in the draft, further solidifying their young receiving group.

Aaron Jones continues to be an efficient running back, ranking among the top in various statistical categories. AJ Dillon complements Jones as a big back and has handled a significant portion of the goal-to-go carries. The Packers have a solid backfield duo that should support Jordan Love as he takes on the starting role.

Kenny Clark remains a productive force on the defensive line, while the departures of Dean Lowry and Jarran Reed opened up opportunities for younger players like Devonte Wyatt and TJ Slaton. The injury to Rashan Gary is a concern, but the Packers addressed it by drafting Lukas Van Ness in the first round. Preston Smith also had a productive season in 2022.

The linebacker position features De'Vondre Campbell and Quay Walker, who both showed effectiveness in their roles. The secondary is anchored by standout cornerback Jaire Alexander, Rasul Douglas and Eric Stokes provide solid options on the other side. Safety remains a concern for the Packers, with Darnell Savage struggling in recent seasons and a lack of reliable options at the position.

To have a successful season, the Packers will rely heavily on their young players stepping up quickly to support their inexperienced quarterback, Jordan Love. The coaching staff will also play a vital role in implementing a smarter strategy, devising better plays, and being adaptable throughout the season. While expectations may be low, the Packers have an opportunity to surprise and prove doubters wrong if they can effectively utilize their resources and make the necessary adjustments to compete in a challenging division.
