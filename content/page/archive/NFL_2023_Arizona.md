The Arizona Cardinals had a mixed performance in the 2022 NFL season, facing several challenges that affected their overall performance. The team had lost Christian Kirk, and while they signed Marquise Brown as a potential replacement, his presence didn't offset the loss entirely. Analyzing quarterback Kyler Murray's performance when each receiver was on the field showed a significant difference in his efficiency in 2021 and 2022.

With Christian Kirk in 2021, Murray performed better, averaging 8.0 yards per attempt (YPA), 68% completions, +0.16 expected points added per attempt (EPA/att), a 5.7% touchdown rate (TD rate), and 44% of completions gaining 10+ yards. In 2022, when Marquise Brown was on the field, Murray's stats dropped, with 5.9 YPA, 65% completions, +0.04 EPA/att, a 3.0% TD rate, and 37% of completions gaining 10+ yards.

One significant reason for the Cardinals' struggles in 2022 was their inability to convert long-yardage third downs. In 2021, the team set a historical record, converting an impressive 56% of third-and-7-to-10-yard attempts into first downs. However, in 2022, they regressed significantly in this area, resulting in more punts, field goals, or turnovers on downs. This regression affected their overall EPA, which dropped from +46.3 in 2021 to -19.4 in 2022 on third-and-long plays.

Another factor contributing to the Cardinals' struggles was the decline in Kyler Murray's performance. In 2022, Murray had his worst season in the NFL, recording career lows in various metrics, including yards per attempt, success rate, accuracy, TD rate, and first down rate. He struggled with deep passes, having the lowest completion rate on throws of 20+ yards since at least 2000.

The Cardinals also faced significant injury issues in the 2022 season. Their top targets, Marquise Brown, DeAndre Hopkins, and Zach Ertz, did not play any games together due to various injuries and suspensions. The team suffered injuries across the offense, affecting their overall performance.

Coaching also played a role in the Cardinals' struggles. Kliff Kingsbury's play calling and decision-making came under scrutiny. For example, the team's usage of play action dropped significantly in 2022, despite its effectiveness in improving the offense's performance.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, the Cardinals are in a rebuilding phase. Kyler Murray's early extension and the lack of success in the previous year put the team in a tough situation. Their roster spend, especially on defense, is relatively low compared to other teams, which may be a challenge for their new defensive coordinator, Jonathan Gannon.

The Arizona Cardinals faced significant challenges in their passing game during the 2022 season. Quarterback Kyler Murray struggled to find his rhythm and had early-career lows in various passing metrics, including yards per pass attempt, yards per completion, and touchdown rate. His recovery from ACL surgery cast uncertainty over his availability for the start of the 2023 season. In case Murray is unavailable, the team has Colt McCoy to bridge the gap, and they also drafted Clayton Tune in the fifth round to add depth to the quarterback position.

The Cardinals' receiving corps faced multiple injuries in the 2022 season. Key players like DeAndre Hopkins, Marquise Brown, Zach Ertz, and Rondale Moore missed significant games due to suspensions or injuries. The lack of continuity affected their overall performance, and the team struggled, recording the worst yards per route run in the NFL. Additionally, the Cardinals released DeAndre Hopkins and A.J. Green retired, leaving a void in the receiving unit. The outlook for 2023 will depend on how the new additions and remaining players can step up to fill the gaps.

The Cardinals' rushing game was slightly better than their passing game in 2022, but they still faced challenges. James Conner, when healthy, performed well, but his history of injuries remains a concern. Other running backs on the roster didn't provide a significant impact, and the team didn't make significant additions to the backfield during the offseason. The Cardinals need to address their running back situation and improve their rushing attack to complement their passing game effectively.

The Cardinals' defense had its share of struggles in 2022, with the defensive line facing some issues. Leki Fotu is currently their top interior defender, but the line lacks a standout pass rusher after losing key players who had high quarterback hit counts. The edge rusher position is relatively thin, and the team is relying on second-year players like Myjai Sanders to step up. Zaven Collins and Isaiah Simmons showed promise in run defense and pass coverage, respectively, but the secondary needs improvement, especially with the uncertainty surrounding Budda Baker's trade request. The defense overall needs strengthening to become more competitive in the upcoming season.

The Cardinals had a significant draft haul in 2023, thanks to Monti Ossenfort's trades. They acquired extra first and third-round picks, which may provide them with valuable assets in the future. In the first round, they selected Paris Johnson, a versatile offensive lineman who could be the left tackle of the future. The team also added BJ Ojulari, an edge rusher with immediate impact potential. Other draft picks, like Garrett Williams, Kei'Trel Clark and Michael Wilson, provide depth and potential for improvement in their respective positions. However, it remains to be seen how these rookies will fit into the team's plans and contribute in the 2023 season.

The Cardinals' priority for the 2023 season should be to evaluate their roster, build a team that fits the new coaching staff's strengths, and potentially secure high draft picks to strengthen their squad for the future. Expectations should be set low, but the team should aim to improve their performance at home, where they have struggled in recent years.

Overall, the outlook for the 2023 Arizona Cardinals is uncertain, but with careful planning and development, they can lay the groundwork for future success.
