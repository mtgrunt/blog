Four teams to watch:   
  
The Bills have been dominant. I think Buffalo's defense is most imposing; this team lies in their formidable defense, which has proven to be the most striking in the league. Their depth and skill on the defensive side of the ball are unparalleled and the return of Von Miller has only added to their strength. Bills offense is on fire, the Bills' offense has been nothing short of electric. The offensive line has been incredibly productive where it counts the most, protecting their star quarterback and opening up lanes for James Cook and others. Perhaps the most telling statistic of their offensive prowess is the fact that their percentage of drives ending in a punt or turnover stands at a mere 33%, making them the third-lowest in the NFL. All signs point to a promising season for the Buffalo Bills AND the Bills mafia.
  
I was wrong. The Vikings are dismal, on top of that, the Chiefs will be in the building of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. The Vikings will pass alot on the Chiefs. Vikings won more games last year, 2022, than any season since signing Kirk Cousins. However, it was clear that something wasn't clicking for Cousins and the Vikings' offense. In 2022, Cousins had his worst season in terms of yards per catch, completion percentage and touchdown percentage. The question of whether to extend Cousins' deal looms large, with his performance becoming a critical factor in that decision.
  
I thought Joe Burrow was 90%-95% physical, he wasn't. In Week 5 of the 2023 NFL season, the Cincinnati Bengals faced a critical matchup against the Arizona Cardinals. Burrow labeled the game a must-win, and it was indeed crucial for the Bengals, who risked falling to a disappointing one-win and four-loss record if they couldn't secure the victory.I think it's a treacherous game and I don't depend on the Bengals right now. With three losses already on their record, it seemed like the Bengals were finding ways to win out of sheer desperation rather than dominating as many had anticipated. The Bengals were expected to be a short list contender, but the Bengals have lost three games. They find a way to win just out of raw fear. Bengals ability to turn their season around is in question.
  
In Week 5 of the 2023 NFL season, the Detroit Lions have emerged as a surprising force to be reckoned with. What's particularly striking is their mastery of play-action passes, leading the league in this department. Their ability to keep opponents off balance with well-executed play-action has been a key to their early success. Facing the Detroit Lions, the Carolina Panthers and their talented young quarterback Bryce Young face the challenge of slowing the game down and finding ways to disrupt the Lions' offensive rhythm. What sets the Lions apart is their remarkable offensive line, Taylor Decker (LT), Jonah Jackson (LG), Frank Ragnow (C), Halapoulivaati Vaitai (RG) and Penei Sewell (RT). This formidable O-line has provided the foundation for the Lions' offensive prowess. Plus, Defensive line is unbelievable with Aidan Hutchinson. Detroit is rising fast.
