49ers (5-3)
The Week 10 clash between San Francisco 49ers and Jacksonville Jaguars at EverBank Stadium sets the stage for a compelling showdown. With Trent Williams day to day and Aaron Banks and Dre Greenlaw questionable for their return. San Francisco 49ers' offensive and defensive lines face uncertainty. However, the potential return of playmaker Deebo Samuel and the activation of Robert Beal Jr., Darrell Luter Jr., and Samuel Womack III from IR or PUP. The 49ers' defense presents a tale of two halves in Weeks 1-5, excelling in pass defense but struggling against the run and Weeks 6-8, where both pass and run defense slumped. On the other side, the Jacksonville Jaguars enter the game as one of the NFL's hottest teams, while the 49ers retain their status as Super Bowl contenders. This clash promises to be a test of resilience and potential turning points for both teams.
  
Browns (5-3)
The Week 10 showdown between Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium holds significant intrigue. The Browns' Greg Newsome II is listed as questionable, possibly affecting their defense. While the Ravens' Morgan Moses and Marcus Williams also carry questionable statuses. The odds favor the Ravens, indicated by a -6 point spread. Baltimore's Lamar Jackson is a top contender for the regular season's MVP, showcasing his exceptional skills and leadership on the field. Furthermore, Keaton Mitchell's presence in the Ravens' backfield could pose a significant threat, potentially exploiting the Browns' defense and making an impact in the ground game. This matchup holds the promise of high-stakes action and the potential to shape the postseason landscape.

Lions (6-2)
In Week 10, the Detroit Lions will face the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium with a few key player updates. Jason Cibinda is on Injured Reserve for the Lions, impacting their defensive depth. The Lions are slight favorites with a 1.5-point spread, indicating a potentially close contest. However, there are uncertainties on the Lions' side with David Montgomery, Jonah Jackson and Frank Ragnow listed as questionable. The Chargers have no reported injury concerns, providing them with stability in their lineup. This matchup offers the potential for an intriguing battle between the Lions and the Chargers in the quest for victory at SoFi Stadium.

Seahawks (5-3)
In the upcoming Week 10 matchup at Lumen Field, the Seattle Seahawks are favored by 6 points as they prepare to face the Washington Commanders. Despite the Commanders leading the series historically with a 13-6 record against the Seahawks, the current circumstances may be in favor of Seattle. The Commanders' Curtis Samuel is listed as questionable, while the Seahawks have no reported starting injuries. Seattle's quarterback, Geno Smith, is coming off a challenging performance against the Ravens, where he struggled to complete passes and had difficulties against the formidable Baltimore defense. Smith must bounce-back performance to secure a win at home. This matchup presents an opportunity for the Seahawks to regain momentum and make a statement against the Commanders.
