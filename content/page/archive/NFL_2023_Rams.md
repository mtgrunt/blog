The Los Angeles Rams had a challenging 2022 season, facing a significant shift in their roster and suffering from a series of injuries. Their defense, which was once ranked 7th, saw a notable decline, ranking 32nd in 2023. The offense also experienced a decline, dropping from the top spot in cash spending to 25th. This drastic transformation in the team's composition reflects a complete overhaul of their approach.

During the 2022 season, the Rams took a different approach to building their team. They drafted an impressive 14 players and spent the least amount of money in free agency, ranking 32nd. This marked a departure from their previous strategy, which relied heavily on trades and key signings in free agency rather than focusing on the draft.

In terms of key signings, the Rams surprised many by making only one significant move in the free agency, signing backup QB Brett Rypien to a one-year, $1.1M deal. This move seemed relatively low-key compared to their previous seasons, where they had been more aggressive in free agency.

The 2022 season was marked by a series of injuries, especially to key contributors such as Matthew Stafford, Cooper Kupp, and Allen Robinson. Despite the absence of these stars, the Rams showed statistical improvement on both early downs and in all quarters of the game, indicating the resilience of their roster.

However, quarterback Matthew Stafford's performance declined significantly in 2022 compared to the previous season. He struggled in various stable QB metrics, especially against man coverage, where he had excelled in 2021. This drop in performance affected the team's passing attack and their ability to capitalize on passing plays.

The lack of pre-snap motion against man coverage appeared to be a major contributing factor to the offensive struggles. When using pre-snap motion, the Rams' offense performed significantly better, while a lack of motion led to poor results. Despite this, the team's usage of pre-snap motion decreased in 2022, raising questions about the team's approach to offensive strategy.

The Los Angeles Rams had a challenging 2022 season when it came to passing. Starting quarterback Matthew Stafford struggled throughout the season, facing issues with his throwing arm and eventually suffering a spinal contusion that ended his year after just nine games. Stafford's performance was disappointing, with his touchdown rate, yards per pass attempt, and yards per completion all at their lowest levels in years. However, the Rams' head coach, Sean McVay, has expressed confidence in Stafford's recovery and expects him to have no limitations heading into the 2023 season.

In terms of receiving, the Rams heavily relied on Cooper Kupp, who had an impressive season despite Stafford's struggles. Kupp ranked near the top in targets, receptions, and receiving yards. However, beyond Kupp, the team lacked significant receiving threats. Allen Robinson, who was expected to be a key addition, didn't pan out, and the Rams have not made significant moves in free agency to bolster their receiving corps. They are entering the 2023 season with a relatively unproven group of receivers, which puts added pressure on Kupp to continue his standout performances.

The Rams' rushing game was another area of concern in 2022. The team's running backs struggled to find success on the ground, ranking near the bottom of the league in various rushing metrics. Cam Akers showed some promise towards the end of the season, but the overall performance of the running game was subpar. The team's only addition to the backfield in the offseason was Zach Evans, who may add depth but does not guarantee an immediate impact.

Defensively, the Rams still have Aaron Donald, who remains one of the most dominant players in the league. However, the team lacks quality depth in the interior and needs to rely on younger and less experienced players to step up. The edge position also faces uncertainty, with Michael Hoecht emerging as a surprise contributor but needing more support. The Rams used draft picks to add to their pass-rushing options, but there are question marks surrounding the newcomers' potential impact.

At linebacker, Ernest Jones has shown promise and is expected to take on a more significant role in 2023. He will need to continue developing his skills to lead the linebacker group effectively. In the secondary, the Rams have some young players with potential, but they also struggled in 2022. Derion Kendrick and Robert Rochell will be relied upon as outside cornerbacks, while Cobie Durant shows promise as the team's slot corner. The safety position will see changes, with Nick Scott and Taylor Rapp no longer on the roster, and Jordan Fuller, if healthy, will play a crucial role.

Regarding the 2023 draft class, the Rams focused on adding depth across various positions. They acquired 14 selections, with some rookies expected to have immediate impacts as backups. The team made moves to address the offensive line, edge position, cornerback, running back, and wide receiver. However, the impact of this draft class will largely depend on how well they contribute and adapt to the NFL level.

Looking ahead to 2023, the Rams face a tough road with a challenging schedule and a roster that underwent significant changes. Injuries are expected to regress, but the schedule remains formidable. The team will also have to address their rest issues, as they face the most rest disadvantages among all NFL teams, making it difficult to compete at the highest level.

Ultimately, the Rams will need to find a balance between their offensive strategies and utilize pre-snap motion more effectively to maximize their offensive potential. Additionally, quarterback Matthew Stafford will need to regain his 2021 form to lead the team effectively. The success of the 2023 season will largely depend on how the Rams can adapt to these challenges and find ways to overcome them.
