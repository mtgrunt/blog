In 2022, the Washington Commanders faced significant challenges with their quarterback situation. Carson Wentz, who was expected to bring talent to the team, proved to be a poor fit for Washington's offense. Wentz had ranked last in accuracy over the previous two years and struggled on third downs, often ending with sacks or interceptions. Additionally, when pressured on early downs, Wentz delivered less EPA (Expected Points Added) than any other quarterback in the league.

Analyzing Wentz's performance with Washington, his accuracy ranked low, especially on throws beyond 5 air yards. He struggled in delivering accurate passes downfield and had a low success rate. On the positive side, Wentz performed better on throws between 1-5 air yards, where he had a higher completion rate and EPA.

Furthermore, the Washington offensive line, which had been regarded as strong in pass blocking, proved to be less effective when the ball was thrown beyond the first-down marker or over 5 yards downfield. The line allowed a high pressure rate in these situations, indicating that Wentz did not have sufficient protection to make successful deep throws.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, the Commanders face several challenges. They have a difficult projected strength of schedule, with tough opponents and a gauntlet of games against teams projected to win more than nine games in the final stretch. The team's performance in one-score games might regress slightly, and they have a relatively inexperienced quarterback in Jacoby Brissett. The offensive line will need to improve its pass block win rate and adjusted sack rate.

The Commanders' unit rankings are concerning, as they rank 20th or worse in every offensive category. This lack of talent and performance could lead to significant changes within the organization. Head coach Ron Rivera has not had a winning season since 2017, and the team's ownership situation and potential distractions could impact their performance.

The outlook for the Commanders' 2023 season is uncertain. While they have some advantages in terms of rest and defensive performance, they face significant challenges in their schedule and the overall quality of their roster. The quarterback situation remains unsettled, and the lack of skill position talent, combined with a shaky offensive line, adds to the team's struggles. The front seven of the defense is their strongest unit, but there are concerns about the secondary.

In terms of fantasy football, the Commanders' defense is considered solid, but the backfield needs improvement. Brian Robinson and Antonio Gibson struggled with efficiency, and Robinson's lack of involvement in the passing game limits his fantasy value. Gibson is the better option, especially in PPR formats, but both running backs have question marks. The team's passing game is also uncertain, with a competition between Jacoby Brissett and Sam Howell for the starting quarterback role.

Overall, the Washington Commanders face challenges in the 2023 season. While there are some positive aspects, such as rest advantages and a strong front seven on defense, there are significant concerns about the quarterback situation, offensive line performance, and overall talent and rankings across offensive units. The team's success will depend on improvements in these areas and the ability to overcome a difficult schedule.
