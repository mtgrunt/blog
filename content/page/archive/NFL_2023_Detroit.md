The Detroit Lions had a challenging 2021 season, being considered underdogs in all 17 games. Despite winning only three games, they showed determination and belief in head coach Dan Campbell's vision. In fact, they achieved something that only nine other teams since 2000 have done: they covered the spread at a 65% rate in at least 10 games as underdogs. Their impressive performance led them to go 11-6 against the spread (ATS) in 2021, winning three of their final six games outright.

Heading into the 2022 season, the Lions were projected to win 6.5 games, an improvement from the previous year's five projected wins. However, they were favored in just three of their 17 games during the summer. Despite this, the Lions exceeded expectations once again, covering the spread in 12 of their 17 games and winning a total of nine games. They were on the brink of making the playoffs.

Entering the 2023 season, the Lions find themselves in a different position. They are now favored in 11 games and predicted to finish first in the NFC North. This would be a significant achievement for the Lions, as their last first-place finish in the division was in 1993, thirty seasons ago.

Looking back at the 2022 season, the Lions showed significant improvement in their offensive performance. They jumped from being ranked 29th in offensive efficiency in 2021 to 6th in 2022. Their passing offense also improved from 28th to 5th. They had four returning starters along the offensive line, which is the third-most expensive unit in the NFL.

However, it's important to note that the Lions' success wasn't without challenges. They had a rocky start to the 2022 season, going 1-6 through the first eight weeks. They experienced a particularly disappointing loss against the New England Patriots, which head coach Dan Campbell described as hitting rock bottom. The team faced further setbacks after their bye week, losing consecutive games to the Cowboys and the Dolphins.

Despite these setbacks, the Lions turned their season around and won six of their next seven games, bringing their record to 7-7 through Week 15. Several factors contributed to their turnaround, including a significant shift in personnel groupings, fewer turnovers, and improved fourth-quarter production.

The Lions made a strategic change in their offensive personnel deployment, utilizing 2-back sets more frequently. This adjustment proved effective, with the team ranking 3rd in expected points added per attempt when using 2+ running backs on early downs. They also experienced a reduction in turnovers, which had a direct impact on their success. They won eight games when winning the turnover battle and lost all six games when losing the turnover battle.

In the fourth quarter, the Lions significantly improved their production from Week 9 onward. They became the top-ranked team in points per drive, scoring rate, touchdown rate, red zone drive rate, and turnover rate. This late-game success played a crucial role in their ability to come back and win games.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, the Lions have made changes to their roster and offensive strategy. They drafted tight end Sam LaPorta and plan to utilize him in more 2-TE sets. However, they may need to be flexible early in the season due to the suspension of wide receiver Jameson Williams. The Lions also acquired running back David Montgomery and drafted Jahmyr Gibbs to maintain their effective 2-back sets from the previous season.

The Lions' offensive approach is expected to emphasize shorter, higher-completion rate passes, which can help reduce interceptions. Quarterback Jared Goff's target depth decreased in the second half of the 2022 season, and this trend is likely to continue. The Lions' success will also depend on their ability to maintain a strong fourth-quarter performance, although relying on late-game comebacks is not a sustainable strategy.

The Detroit Lions took some bold risks with their draft class in 2023. They selected Jahmyr Gibbs in the first round, an explosive athlete but undersized for the running back position. Gibbs excelled in situations where defenses were spread out, but the Lions often faced stacked boxes. While Gibbs is expected to make an impact in the passing game, his skill set may be better suited for a complementary role rather than a workhorse role. Jack Campbell was another surprising first-round pick as an off-ball linebacker. While this position is not heavily invested in by most teams, Campbell addresses a clear need in the Lions' struggling defense. Sam LaPorta, a second-round pick, is a talented tight end who may have a clear path to targets but is expected to be a downgrade in blocking compared to T.J. Hockenson. The rest of the draft class consists of players who will likely serve as backups or have specific roles in the team's defensive scheme.

Jared Goff had his best season since 2018, throwing for over 4,000 yards and showing improved efficiency. The Lions had a strong passing offense, ranking third in EPA per dropback. Goff's performance was similar to his career average, with a slightly higher rate of downfield throws. This suggests that Goff can continue to perform well in 2023 and beyond.

Amon-Ra St. Brown had an excellent sophomore season, ranking eighth in yards per route run and showcasing his playmaking ability. However, the Lions lack depth at the receiver position, especially with Jameson Williams facing a six-game suspension. Sam LaPorta, the rookie tight end, may have a significant role in the passing game due to his collegiate success, but questions remain about his blocking ability.

The Lions had a successful rushing attack in 2022, led by Jamaal Williams and D'Andre Swift. However, both players have moved on, and the Lions signed David Montgomery and drafted Jahmyr Gibbs as their replacements. Gibbs brings explosive playmaking ability, while Montgomery provides a solid rushing option. With a strong offensive line, the Lions' rushing game should continue to be productive.

The Lions' defense struggled in 2022, ranking poorly against the run and pass rush. They addressed these issues by selecting defensive players early in the draft, including linebacker Jack Campbell. The interior defensive line remains a concern, but the addition of Aidan Hutchinson and James Houston should provide a boost to the pass rush. The secondary also received reinforcements with the additions of Cameron Sutton, Emmanuel Moseley and C.J. Gardner-Johnson. These additions should help improve the Lions' pass defense, which struggled in 2022.

The Lions' success in the 2023 season will depend on their defense taking a step forward. If the defense fails to improve, the offense will face constant pressure to perform at a high level, which can be challenging. Additionally, the team hopes to have better injury luck in the upcoming season.

In conclusion, the Detroit Lions showed resilience and improvement throughout the 2022 season. They exceeded expectations and are now favored in 11 games for the 2023 season. The team's success will rely on maintaining their offensive improvements, addressing roster needs, and continuing their strong fourth-quarter performances. If they manage to win double-digit games and claim the NFC North title, it could be a transformative moment for the organization, potentially leading to significant changes in the future.
