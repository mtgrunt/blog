## Arab League Summit in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia:

President Volodymyr Zelensky's attendance at the Arab League Summit in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, comes at a time when many Arab leaders have maintained warm ties with Moscow despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The summit, hosted by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, aims to foster regional rapprochement and address various issues in the Arab world.

Saudi Arabia has recently pursued diplomatic efforts, restoring ties with Iran, mediating between Ukraine and Russia, and leading initiatives for Syria's return to the Arab League. President Zelensky's presence at the summit provides an opportunity to discuss the treatment of Muslim Tatars living under Russian occupation in Crimea. It also reflects the growing bilateral relations between Ukraine and Saudi Arabia, with the latter pledging $400 million in aid to Ukraine and supporting UN resolutions condemning Russia's invasion.

The summit's agenda extends beyond Ukraine, with a focus on Sudan, where top generals backed by Saudi Arabia and other Arab states have been engaged in a month-long conflict. The leaders are expected to address the situation in Sudan and explore avenues for a lasting truce. Additionally, the Arab League reaffirms its support for the Palestinians amid heightened tensions in the Middle East.

The presence of Syrian President Bashar Assad at the summit is notable, marking his return to the Arab fold after 12 years of suspension due to the civil war. Saudi Arabia's efforts to reintegrate Syria into the regional politics reflect a shift towards a more cautious approach in its foreign policy, focusing on countering extremist groups and drug traffickers. However, Western countries, including the United States, maintain their opposition to Assad's regime and vow to uphold sanctions.

President Zelensky's participation in the Arab League Summit provides an opportunity to engage with Arab leaders who have largely remained neutral on Russia's aggression towards Ukraine. It enables him to advocate for Ukraine's interests, discuss the plight of Crimean Tatars, and strengthen bilateral relations with Arab countries, particularly Saudi Arabia.

## Group of Seven Summit in Hiroshima, Japan:

While there is no mention of President Zelensky's attendance at the Group of Seven (G7) Summit in Hiroshima, Japan, it is essential to understand the context of the summit and the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

The G7 Summit brings together leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, along with representatives from the European Union. The summit focuses on global issues, economic cooperation, and shared values among the member countries.

Regarding Ukraine, the G7 countries have consistently condemned Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea and provided support to Ukraine through diplomatic means, economic aid, and sanctions against Russia. The G7 leaders are likely to reiterate their commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity during the summit.

It is crucial to note that the situation in Ukraine is dynamic, and the G7 countries' stance and actions may evolve based on the latest developments. The G7 leaders may discuss Ukraine in the context of broader geopolitical challenges, such as Russia's aggressive actions, China's rising influence, and regional security concerns.

However, without specific information on President Zelensky's participation in the G7 Summit, it is challenging to provide further insights into the discussions or outcomes related to Ukraine.
