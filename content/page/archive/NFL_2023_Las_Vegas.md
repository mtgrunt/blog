The outlook for the Las Vegas Raiders in 2023 under head coach and play caller Josh McDaniels is a cause for concern for fans and players alike. McDaniels' track record raises questions about his ability to lead and improve offenses. In his previous coaching stints in Denver and St. Louis, the offenses he was in charge of performed poorly and ranked among the worst in the league. Additionally, McDaniels' offenses in New England were not impressive when he didn't have Tom Brady as his quarterback.

The Raiders' performance in 2022, under McDaniels, was disappointing. Despite having a similar roster to the previous year and adding talented wide receiver Davante Adams, the team finished with a 6-11 record, worse than the previous year's 10-7 playoff season. The offense struggled even when key players like Darren Waller and Hunter Renfrow were healthy. The team went 1-6 in games when both Waller and Renfrow started, and one of their wins was a result of a controversial play.

Derek Carr, the Raiders' quarterback, experienced a decline in performance in McDaniels' offense. His completion percentage dropped, and he ranked poorly in several quarterback metrics compared to the previous year. McDaniels failed to adapt and utilize the strengths of the players on the roster effectively.

While McDaniels had success as an offensive coordinator in New England with Tom Brady as his quarterback, there is an argument that his success was heavily influenced by Brady and the overall team talent. McDaniels' inability to replicate that success without Brady raises doubts about his capabilities as an elite offensive coordinator and play caller.

Looking ahead to 2023, there are concerns about McDaniels' offensive scheme and the fit with the Raiders' personnel. The team has undergone changes, losing key players like Waller and Foster Moreau while adding Austin Hooper and rookie Michael Mayer. Furthermore, the Raiders' decision to start Jimmy Garoppolo at quarterback poses challenges. Garoppolo is accustomed to a different offensive system in San Francisco, which focused on heavy personnel groupings and shorter passes. McDaniels' preference for 11 personnel and deep passing could potentially hinder Garoppolo's performance and limit the offense's effectiveness.

The Raiders' defense was one of the worst in the league in 2022, and there are doubts about their ability to improve significantly in 2023, especially considering their schedule has become tougher. The team's defense ranked poorly in various metrics despite facing relatively easier offensive opponents. With a limited improvement in the defense and the offense potentially struggling under McDaniels, it is uncertain whether the Raiders can compete in a division that features strong teams like the Kansas City Chiefs, Denver Broncos with Sean Payton as head coach, and the Los Angeles Chargers with Kellen Moore as their offensive play caller.

The Raiders' past struggles in maintaining leads and their poor second-half performances also raise concerns about McDaniels' coaching ability and decision-making. The team lost multiple games in which they held double-digit halftime leads, and their second-half performance in terms of offensive efficiency and scoring significantly declined.

In 2022, Derek Carr had a down season with a 60.8% completion rate, his lowest since his rookie year, and a career-worst 2.8% interception rate. The Raiders made the decision to release Carr, bringing in Jimmy Garoppolo as their new starting quarterback for the 2023 season. Garoppolo reunites with offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who coached him during his early years with the Patriots. Despite Garoppolo's limitations, he ranked fourth in the NFL in expected points added per play in 2022, highlighting his ability to make positive contributions to the team's success. While some may criticize Garoppolo's statistical analysis, his track record of quarterback wins (40-17 as a starter) cannot be ignored. The change in quarterback signals a fresh start for the Raiders' passing game, and it will be interesting to see how Garoppolo fits into their offensive system.

Davante Adams had a standout season in 2022, receiving a career-high 180 targets and leading the league in touchdown receptions with 14. However, the Raiders traded away tight end Darren Waller, making changes to their receiving corps. They signed Jakobi Meyers and drafted Michael Mayer in the second round of the 2023 draft. Meyers is coming off a solid season, averaging 4.8 receptions and a career-high 57.4 yards per game. Michael Mayer, a highly regarded tight end prospect, was known for his consistent production throughout his collegiate career, averaging the most receptions (5.0) and receiving yards (58.3) per game among all tight ends in his class. With the return of Hunter Renfrow and the addition of Meyers and Mayer, the Raiders' receiving corps has become deeper and younger, providing promising options for the upcoming season.

Josh Jacobs had a remarkable 2022 season, leading the NFL in rushing yards (1,653) and yards from scrimmage (2,053). Despite his outstanding performance, the Raiders declined to pick up his fifth-year option but used the franchise tag on him for the 2023 season. However, Jacobs has yet to sign the franchise tag and did not attend the voluntary offseason program, seeking a longer commitment from the organization. The Raiders have a mix of veteran backs like Ameer Abdullah and Brandon Bolden, as well as three other rookie backs, behind Jacobs. While Jacobs remains a talented running back, his situation and contract negotiations add some uncertainty to the Raiders' rushing attack. The team will need to sort out the running back depth chart and hope for a resolution with Jacobs to solidify their ground game for the upcoming season.

The Raiders' defense had a challenging season in 2022, struggling to generate pressure and stop the run. Maxx Crosby emerged as a standout player, leading the league in tackles for loss and displaying his effectiveness as an edge rusher. However, the team lacked a consistent pass rush threat opposite Crosby, and Chandler Jones, who was expected to fill that role, did not meet expectations. The departure of interior run defender Andrew Billings in free agency further weakened the defensive line. Linebacker Divine Deablo showed promise before suffering a season-ending forearm injury, cutting short what could have been a breakout season for him. The secondary had its share of struggles as well, with Nate Hobbs facing difficulties on the outside. The Raiders made some acquisitions in free agency, bringing in players like Duke Shelley and David Long Jr. to bolster their secondary. The team will need significant improvements on the defensive side of the ball to perform at a higher level in 2023.

The Raiders' 2023 draft class had a mix of players who could contribute immediately and others who may need time to develop. Tyree Wilson, their first-round pick, will serve as a backup to Chandler Jones and potentially take over as the primary pass rusher in the future. Michael Mayer, their second-round pick, will compete for playing time at tight end, challenging Austin Hooper. Mayer brings consistency to the position but may not be a dynamic receiving threat. Byron Young, their third-round pick, will need to adjust to a new role in the defensive scheme, but he showed promise as a pass rusher in college. Nesta Jade Silvera, their seventh-round pick, adds depth to the defensive line with his versatility. Tre Tucker, their third-round pick, has straight-line speed and could earn playing time as a deep threat. The Raiders also selected several defensive backs, including Jakorian Bennett, Christopher Smith and Amari Burney, who will compete for snaps and contribute on special teams. Overall, the Raiders' draft class provides a mix of immediate impact and developmental players, addressing some key areas of need for the team.

Overall, the outlook for the Las Vegas Raiders in 2023 with Josh McDaniels as head coach and play caller is uncertain and worrying. McDaniels' past coaching experiences and the team's underwhelming performance in 2022 cast doubt on his ability to lead the team to success. The offensive scheme may not fully capitalize on the strengths of the players, and the defense remains a significant question mark. Additionally, the competitiveness of the AFC West division further complicates the Raiders' path to success.
