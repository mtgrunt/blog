This is not it. The pass-protecting line is awful on the right side. You know this. Trent Williams and Aaron Banks provide strength on the left side, but Colton McKivitz and Spencer Burford on the right side are concerning. San Francisco's Offensive line grade is a C-. Most columnists thought the 49ers would draft an offensive tackle or an offensive guard with one of their third-round picks. Rather, they’re snug with Colton McKivitz and Spencer Burford. Again, Kyle Shanahan is not seeing the whole picture. He didn't sign a skillful player on the right side of the line. Instead, 49ers signed Jon Feliciano and Matt Pryor in the off-season. I was speechless.  Especially when T.J. Watt's sacked Purdy highlighted the urgency of the situation.

To make a beneficial trade, Shanahan will want a player with background in the wide zone system. NFL teams are afraid to trade quality tackles away because the lack of talent. A superb tackle is gold, a marvelous running back is mediocre because the surplus is vast. Given the strong defenses in teams like Buffalo, Cleveland, Dallas, New England and Philadelphia, the offensive line's strength is paramount. This is vital for the 49ers. McKivitz may not be the answer in these circumstances. 

Again, not sure why Kittle and McCaffrey were playing in the 4th quarter in Pittsburgh. It's a marathon, not a sprint. The season is extremely perennial. Additionally, the team should be exploring the capabilities of other running backs like Elijah Mitchell as potential flexible RB2 options. Aside from that, RB3 is up in the air right now. McCaffrey is a freak of nature, but you got to delve into other avenues, as well. 

Considering the ongoing situation, La'el Collins passed his physical and he is chatting with NFL teams. Unlikely that Carolina will be trading Taylor Moton to S.F., you got to take care of Bryce Young. Improbable, Tom Compton's age and recurring lower-back problems raise concerns, but his familiarity with the 49ers' scheme is a potential advantage. Other options include George Fant, Houston Texans, is an option for the 49ers and Tytus Howard is on track to play Week 6. Also, head-coach is Demeco Ryans, former defensive-coordinator of the 49ers. San Francisco has an opportunity to win the Super Bowl.
