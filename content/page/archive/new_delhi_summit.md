## "New Delhi G20 Summit."

India and Russia have a complex diplomatic relationship, and the upcoming G20 Summit in New Delhi adds a layer of uncertainty. As of now, there is no confirmation about Russian President Vladimir Putin's attendance. When asked about it, Putin responded non-committally, saying he hasn't thought about it and will have to see.

If Putin does attend the G20 Summit, it would mark the first time he meets Western leaders face-to-face after the invasion of Ukraine. This prospect could potentially lead to some tense interactions with leaders like Joe Biden, Rishi Sanak, Emmanuel Macron, and Olaf Scholz.

India, as the host, is obligated to invite all G20 members, and they have officially invited Putin. However, the Indian government's statement about not having any specific information to share regarding physical visits raises questions about whether the invitation is genuine or merely a courtesy.

Putin has visited eight countries since the invasion of Ukraine, including Central Asian nations, Iran, Belarus, and Armenia. These countries either have close partnerships with Russia or hold strong anti-Western sentiments. India, on the other hand, maintains both close relations with Russia and with the West, making the decision to invite Putin a difficult one.

Looking at known variables, Putin skipped the 2022 G20 Summit in Indonesia and will also skip the BRICS Summit in South Africa. The possibility of an arrest warrant by the ICC for Putin is not a problem in India, as they have not signed the ICC Charter. Still, the decision to attend the summit seems to be political, considering Putin's other scheduled visits to Turkey and China.

The issue of Putin's attendance is not merely about scheduling; it is more political in nature. India's concerns revolve around how the West will react if Putin attends. A summit with Putin present would likely revolve primarily around the Ukraine issue, making drafting a joint statement that all G20 members agree to more challenging.

India has positioned itself as a bridging power, but its success in bridging differences at previous G20 meetings has been limited. If the G20 Summit in September faces a similar situation, it could be seen as a major embarrassment for India.

In the context of recent events like the SCO Summit, where India opted for a virtual meeting instead of an in-person one, hosting Putin during the G20 Summit becomes a crucial balancing act for New Delhi. India's decision will have a significant impact on the dynamics of the summit and the possibility of achieving a consensus on important global issues.

Overall, India needs to carefully navigate the situation, considering its diplomatic relations with both Russia and the West, to ensure a successful and productive G20 Summit. The meeting promises to be India's biggest diplomatic challenge yet, requiring all the goodwill the country can muster.
