The 2023 Indianapolis Colts draft class has generated mixed opinions, primarily due to their first-round selection, Anthony Richardson. Richardson's selection was considered one of the biggest gambles in draft history, as he had limited college productivity and inconsistent baseline performance. While comparisons have been made between Richardson and Josh Allen, the metrics do not support those theories. Richardson's highlight-reel plays occasionally overshadow his poor baseline performance. It is believed that Richardson is still years away from performing at a high level, but the Colts' coaching staff, including Shane Steichen and quarterbacks coach Cam Turner, is seen as capable of developing him.

Julius Brents, a second-round pick, is considered a traits-based selection and a project at cornerback. He has the desired size and length for the position but struggled with allowing catches in college. Darius Rush, a fifth-round pick, outperformed Brents in college and is seen as one of the draft's best value picks. With their respective physical attributes, both players could compete for playing time in the secondary. The Colts also added depth to the secondary with Daniel Scott (fifth round) and Jaylon Jones (seventh round).

Josh Downs, a third-round pick, is a reliable slot receiver known for his strong catch rate. He will likely compete with Isaiah McKenzie for snaps in the slot. Blake Freeland, a fourth-round pick, surprised some as a left tackle selection. While he possesses good athleticism, his height hinders his ability to play with leverage and impact the run game. Ade Adebawore (fourth round), an interior defensive lineman, is an exceptional athlete for his size and is expected to contribute in the three-technique role.

The Colts also drafted Will Mallory (fifth round) as an additional tight end, Evan Hull (fifth round) as a potential backup running back, Titus Leo (sixth round) as a linebacker-end tweener, and Jake Witt (seventh round) as a developmental prospect with elite athleticism.

Overall, the Colts' draft class is seen as having high upside, with the potential for multiple long-term starters. However, the success of the class ultimately hinges on the development of Anthony Richardson. Stability within the coaching staff will be crucial for Richardson's growth and progress.

Shifting to the 2022 receiving recap and the 2023 outlook, the Colts' wide receiver corps struggled in multiple statistical categories last season. They ranked near the bottom in yards per route run, yards per catch, and yards after the catch per reception. Michael Pittman, entering the final season of his rookie contract, has yet to have a breakout performance. Among the rookie receivers, Alec Pierce and Jelani Woods showed promise, but the team also drafted Josh Downs in the third round to fill the slot role vacated by Parris Campbell.

In terms of the 2022 rushing performance and the 2023 outlook, the Colts' running game was disappointing. They ranked poorly in expected points added per rush, success rate, and rate of runs resulting in a first down or touchdown. Jonathan Taylor, their star running back, had a subpar season, ranking near the bottom in EPA per rush and success rate. However, Taylor played through an ankle injury, and the offensive line's deterioration also impacted the running game. Taylor's future contract negotiations will be an important storyline as he aims to bounce back.

Regarding fantasy advice, Anthony Richardson's selection suggests that he will have an earlier-than-expected role in the Colts' offense. His rushing potential alone should make him a viable fantasy starter due to his size, speed, and athleticism. However, concerns about his passing ability and the historical lack of production from skill players tied to rookie quarterbacks raise questions about the upside for Indianapolis' pass catchers. Michael Pittman and Jonathan Taylor may not see significant improvements compared to the previous season. Jelani Woods could be a lower-risk option, but the overall upside for the skill players may be limited unless one drafts Richardson himself.

In summary, the 2023 Indianapolis Colts draft class has generated mixed opinions, with the success of Anthony Richardson's development being a crucial factor. The team's receiving corps and rushing game struggled in 2022, but there is optimism for improvement. Fantasy owners should consider the potential limitations tied to Richardson's passing ability when evaluating the Colts' skill players for their fantasy teams.
