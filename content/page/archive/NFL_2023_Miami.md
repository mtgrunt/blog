The Miami Dolphins had an eventful 2022 season with ups and downs, largely influenced by the availability of their starting quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa. Tua led the team to a perfect 3-0 start before sustaining his first concussion in Week 4. The team struggled without him, going 0-3 during his absence. However, upon his return in Week 7, the Dolphins went on an impressive five-game winning streak, making their record 8-0 with Tua and 0-3 without him.

One significant game during the season was against the Green Bay Packers on Christmas. The Dolphins had a 20-10 lead with 2:40 left in the first half, with Tua playing brilliantly. Unfortunately, disaster struck when Tua sustained another concussion but continued to play undiagnosed for the rest of the game. His performance suffered, and the Dolphins ultimately lost by six points. Tua was sidelined for the remainder of the season.

In Week 17, the Dolphins started Teddy Bridgewater at quarterback against the Patriots. Bridgewater performed well in the first half, but a finger injury on his throwing hand forced him out of the game. Miami lost by two points. In the final game of the season, the Dolphins were forced to start rookie Skylar Thompson against the Jets. Despite not trailing throughout the game, the Dolphins only won by a narrow margin of 11-6.

Despite the challenges faced with injuries to their quarterbacks, the Dolphins managed to surpass their win total, make the playoffs, and cash in on various bets. However, the season will be remembered for concerns over Tua's long-term health, overshadowing the team's surprising turnaround under a first-year head coach.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, there are several predictions and outlooks for the Miami Dolphins. In terms of the team's performance in 2022, many of the preseason predictions made about the Dolphins came true. These predictions included improvements in receiver separation, Tua's aggressiveness, pass protection, production on deeper passes, YAC (yards after catch), and third-down efficiency. The Dolphins exceeded expectations by winning at least nine games and making the playoffs.

In terms of offensive stats, Tua's improvement was notable. He became less aggressive in throwing into tight coverage, resulting in improved overall efficiency. His EPA/att (expected points added per attempt), success rate, and YPA (yards per attempt) significantly improved from the previous season. The Dolphins also had better pass protection, leading to more production on deeper passes. They achieved their goal of generating more YAC and performed better on third downs.

Tua Tagovailoa had a breakout season in 2022, leading the Dolphins to an 8-5 record in his 13 starts. In his third season as a starter, Tagovailoa continued to improve his performance. He threw for 25 touchdowns, leading the NFL with a 6.3% touchdown rate. His yards per pass attempt increased significantly from previous seasons, topping the league with 8.9 YPA. From an expected points added perspective, only Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen had higher EPA per dropback than Tagovailoa. He finished the season with a success rate of 47.4%, ranking fifth among all quarterbacks. The Dolphins wasted no time in picking up his fifth-year option, signaling their confidence in his future.

The Dolphins' 2023 schedule is expected to be challenging, just like in the previous season. The team will compete with the Buffalo Bills for the AFC East crown. The Dolphins made changes to their defense, hiring Vic Fangio as the new defensive coordinator. Fangio's experience and defensive expertise are expected to improve the team's performance, especially in high-leverage situations like third downs and the red zone. The defense will aim to reduce opponent drives reaching the red zone, and Fangio's past success in red zone defense bodes well for the Dolphins.

In terms of the 2023 roster, the Dolphins retained most of their offensive unit from 2022. However, they lost TE Mike Gesicki, who played a significant role in third-down efficiency. The team will need to find a replacement for Gesicki to maintain their offensive efficiency. The Dolphins should also focus on squeezing more efficiency out of their play-action passing attack.

The 2023 draft class for the Dolphins was small due to previous trades and forfeiting their first-round pick. However, they acquired valuable players like Cam Smith, a second-round pick, who has potential but might face limited playing time initially. Devon Achane, a third-round pick, brings speed and versatility to the offense. Elijah Higgins, a fifth-round pick, will transition from receiver to tight end, but his impact may be limited initially. Ryan Hayes, a seventh-round pick, will compete for the swing tackle job.

Tyreek Hill was the team's leading receiver in 2022, with 170 targets. He was a significant contributor to the offense, receiving 53 more targets than the next closest player, Jaylen Waddle. Waddle had an impressive rookie season, finishing with 65 more targets than the third-highest targeted Dolphin, Mike Gesicki. Hill and Waddle combined for over 50% of the team's targets, receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns. The Dolphins have not made significant changes to their receiving corps during the offseason, indicating that Hill and Waddle will continue to be the primary targets in the passing game.

Under the guidance of new coach Mike McDaniel, the Dolphins improved their rushing game in 2022. They ranked sixth in the league in expected points added per rush on running back carries and fifth in success rate on those attempts. The team retained all three of their free agent running backs, signing Raheem Mostert, Jeff Wilson and Myles Gaskin to new contracts. They also added Devon Achane in the draft, bringing in more speed to the backfield. Achane showcased his speed at the Combine, recording the fastest forty time among running backs. He averaged 6.2 yards per carry on outside runs, adding another dimension to the rushing attack. With a stronger running game, the Dolphins look to continue their success on the ground in 2023.

Christian Wilkins had an outstanding season in 2022, making a significant impact in the run defense. He led all defensive linemen in tackles, run stuffs, and positive play-producing tackles. Zach Sieler and Raekwon Davis also contributed effectively on the defensive line, with Sieler playing a majority of the snaps and Davis providing space-eating presence. The Dolphins are transitioning from a blitz-heavy scheme to Vic Fangio's system, which focuses on generating pressure with fewer blitzes. While Miami had a high blitz rate in 2022, they ranked just 13th in pressure rate. The presence of Bradley Chubb and Jaelan Phillips on the field together significantly increased the team's pressure rate. Linebackers Jerome Baker and David Long were impressive in coverage, despite being frequently left on an island. The addition of Jalen Ramsey, one of the best in the league, strengthens the secondary and allows Xavien Howard to focus on his strengths. Overall, the Dolphins defense has the potential to improve under the guidance of Vic Fangio and the talented players on the roster.

Overall, the Dolphins had a successful 2022 season despite the challenges they faced. They showed significant improvements offensively and made the playoffs. However, concerns over Tua's long-term health loomed over the season. Looking ahead to 2023, the Dolphins face another tough schedule and will compete with the Bills for the division title. Changes to the coaching staff, particularly on defense, and retaining most of their offensive unit provide optimism for the upcoming season.
