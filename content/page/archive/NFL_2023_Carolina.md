## "NFL 2023 Carolina Panthers."
#### _07/12/2023_

The Carolina Panthers have made several changes heading into the 2023 season. They have a new head coach in Frank Reich, who was previously with the Indianapolis Colts. Reich brings a wealth of experience to the team, having been involved in the NFL since 1985. The Panthers hope that his leadership will help turn the franchise in the right direction.

The offensive coordinator for the Panthers is Thomas Brown, who was previously the assistant head coach for the Los Angeles Rams. The defensive coordinator is Ejiro Evero, who was previously with the Denver Broncos. Both coordinators bring fresh perspectives and new ideas to the team.

In terms of their forecast for the 2023 season, the Panthers are projected to win 7 games. This would be an improvement from their 7-10 record in 2022 and their 5-12 record in 2021. However, it's important to note that the team has not had a winning record in recent years.

The Panthers have made some key player changes in the offseason. They have lost D.J. Moore, Matt Ioannidis, Pat Elflein, Sam Darnold, Damien Wilson, and Cory Littleton. These are significant losses, particularly Moore and Darnold, who were key contributors to the offense.

On the other hand, the Panthers have added some key free agents and trades. They have acquired Adam Thielen, Vonn Bell, Hayden Hurst, Shy Tuttle, Miles Sanders, Andy Dalton and D.J. Chark. These additions bring depth and talent to the team, particularly in the wide receiver and defensive positions.

In the draft, the Panthers selected quarterback Bryce Young from Alabama, wide receiver Jonathan Mingo from Ole Miss and outside linebacker D.J. Johnson from Oregon. These rookies have the potential to make an impact, but it remains to be seen how quickly they will adjust to the NFL.

Overall, the Panthers have invested heavily in their defense, with a focus on improving their pass rush and secondary. This could be a key factor in their success in the upcoming season.

It's worth noting that the Panthers have had a tumultuous time with their quarterbacks in recent years. They have gone through a series of changes, signing and trading various quarterbacks, but have yet to find a long-term solution. The addition of Bryce Young in the draft indicates that the team is looking to develop a young quarterback for the future.

In terms of their offensive performance in 2022, the Panthers struggled in several areas. Their passing attack had a low success rate on dropbacks, ranking second-worst in the league. They also benefited from a high fumble recovery rate and field goal luck, both of which are unlikely to continue in 2023. Additionally, their yardage after the catch and after the rush ranked highly in the league, but this could regress in the upcoming season.

Overall, the Panthers have made significant changes to their coaching staff, roster and draft picks in an effort to improve their performance. While there are some promising additions, it remains to be seen how quickly the team can come together and achieve success. I predict seven wins for the Panthers.
