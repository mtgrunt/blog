The New York Giants had a remarkable turnaround in the 2022 season, going from the worst record in the NFL to a team with a winning record for the first time in six years. Under the leadership of head coach Brian Daboll, the Giants exceeded expectations, covering the spread in 13 of their 17 games, the most in the league. They also improved in key areas that had plagued them in previous seasons.

One of the priorities for the Giants' offense was to increase early down efficiency to bypass third downs. In 2021, they ranked 31st in the percentage of plays that were third downs. However, under Daboll and offensive coordinator Mike Kafka, the Giants improved dramatically, ranking 6th in third-down avoidance. This improvement was solely due to coaching, as the offensive personnel remained largely the same. The Giants' offense played better, sustained longer drives, and scored more points as a result.

Another area of focus was red zone efficiency. In 2021, the Giants ranked near the bottom in red zone conversion rate and pass success. However, in 2022, they improved significantly, ranking 7th in red zone conversion rate and 6th in goal-to-go efficiency. This improvement was crucial in their offensive success and resulted in more points scored.

The Giants also aimed to generate more explosive plays. In 2021, they ranked in the bottom five in plays of 10+, 15+, and 20+ yards. This lack of explosiveness hindered their offensive productivity. While it is challenging to increase both early down efficiency and explosive plays simultaneously, the Giants made progress in this area as well.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, the Giants face several challenges. They have a bottom-4 quarterback and limited cap space, making it difficult to make significant roster improvements. They also have a tough schedule, with more games having a rest disadvantage than a rest advantage. Additionally, the Giants were fortunate in some aspects in the 2022 season, such as winning one-score games and benefiting from turnovers, which may be difficult to replicate.

However, there are reasons to be optimistic. The Giants have addressed some of their roster needs through the draft and free agency, adding players like Deonte Banks and Bobby Okereke. They also have an elite kicker in Graham Gano, who provides an advantage in close games. Furthermore, the coaching staff, led by Brian Daboll, has shown its ability to improve player performance and scheme effectiveness.

Unit rankings show that the Giants have areas of strength, such as a top-10 front seven on defense and a talented backfield led by Saquon Barkley. However, their receiving corps and offensive line are areas of concern. The Giants' success in the 2023 season will depend on the development of Daniel Jones as a passer, the performance of their receivers, and the overall improvement of their offense.

In summary, the New York Giants made significant strides in the 2022 season under new head coach Brian Daboll. They improved in key areas such as early down efficiency, red zone efficiency, and explosive plays. While there are challenges and areas of concern for the 2023 season, there is reason to be optimistic about the team's future based on coaching effectiveness, roster additions, and potential player development. I predict nine wins for the Giants.
