Mike McCarthy is a football coach known for his tenure with the Green Bay Packers and his current role as the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys. While he has achieved success in his career, there are concerns about his offensive play-calling and decision-making.

In Green Bay, McCarthy had a well-rounded roster and a talented quarterback in Aaron Rodgers. However, his conservative play-calling and reliance on the running game limited the team's success. Despite having a potent passing attack, the run game consistently ranked around average.

One major criticism of McCarthy is his team's performance in the second half of games. The Packers often lost leads and struggled to maintain pressure on opponents, leading to close games and missed opportunities. McCarthy's tendency to prioritize running the ball in these situations, despite having an elite quarterback, has drawn criticism.

Despite his flaws, McCarthy had a successful stretch with the Packers from 2009 to 2012, reaching the playoffs four times and winning a Super Bowl. However, from 2013 to 2018, the team's performance declined, and McCarthy was eventually fired.

After taking a year off, McCarthy joined the Dallas Cowboys as their head coach. The team has achieved back-to-back 12-win seasons under his leadership, but concerns resurfaced when he announced his plans to take over play-calling duties and prioritize a run-heavy offense in 2023.

McCarthy's emphasis on time of possession and ball security has raised red flags, as it resembles his approach in Green Bay that led to his dismissal. His willingness to sacrifice offensive production and rely on the running game to protect leads has drawn criticism, especially given the presence of a talented quarterback like Dak Prescott.

In summary, while Mike McCarthy has experienced success as a head coach, his conservative play-calling, reluctance to rely on his quarterbacks, and prioritization of the running game have been sources of concern throughout his career.

The Dallas Cowboys made some interesting choices in the draft, focusing on improving their run defense and adding immediate starters. Here's a breakdown of their draft picks and their potential impact. Mazi Smith is a run-stopping defensive tackle who should contribute immediately when the Cowboys line up in a three-man front. He struggled as an interior pass rusher in college but could help improve the team's run defense. Luke Schoonmaker is a balanced tight end who excels as a blocker and receiver. He could potentially replace Dalton Schultz but might have a limited ceiling as a pass catcher. DeMarvion Overshown overshown is a hybrid safety/linebacker who doesn't fit a traditional role. It will be up to defensive coordinator Dan Quinn to design a role that highlights his strengths in coverage. Viliami Fehoko (DT, fourth round): Fehoko pairs well with Smith and excels at defending the run. While he may not provide significant pass-rush contributions, his selection shows the team's focus on improving the run defense. Overall, the Cowboys focused on immediate production in this draft, potentially adding two immediate starters in Smith and Schoonmaker. While there may not be a lot of long-term upside in this class, the team's emphasis on improving their run defense was justified given the state of the NFC.

In 2023, the Dallas Cowboys' passing game had its ups and downs. Despite a successful overall offensive performance, led by quarterback Dak Prescott, there were some concerning aspects. After Prescott returned from his injury, the team ranked sixth in EPA (Expected Points Added) per play. However, Prescott himself had his lowest passing yards per game and set a career-high with 17 interceptions in just 14 games, including the playoffs. While some of those interceptions can be attributed to bad luck, it seems that the high turnover rate is influencing head coach Mike McCarthy's desire to prioritize the running game. This decision may not fully capitalize on Prescott's usual efficiency, as he still ranked ninth in EPA per dropback despite the interceptions. Furthermore, the addition of Brandin Cooks to the receiving corps could potentially enhance the passing attack if utilized effectively. The quarterback position is ranked in the back half of the top 10, with Dak Prescott's injuries being a small concern. Cooper Rush's competent performance in five starts last year adds confidence to the ranking.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, the Cowboys' passing game will be under the guidance of offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer, with McCarthy calling the plays. The team will need to find a balance between running the ball and allowing Prescott to showcase his passing skills. Prescott has demonstrated his ability to be an efficient quarterback, and with the addition of Cooks, there is potential for the passing game to flourish. It will be crucial for the coaching staff to design a game plan that maximizes Prescott's strengths while minimizing turnovers. If they can strike the right balance, the Cowboys' passing game has the potential to be a potent force in the upcoming season.

In 2022, CeeDee Lamb had an impressive season, recording 107 catches for 1,359 yards and 9 touchdowns. However, the rest of the receiving group struggled to make a significant impact. Michael Gallup, returning from a major injury, ranked 80th out of 85 qualifying receivers in yards per route run. Noah Brown wasn't much better, ranking 67th. Dalton Schultz had a decent season with a 57-577-5 stat line in 15 games, but overall, the supporting cast behind Lamb was underwhelming.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, the Cowboys have made changes to their receiving corps. Schultz and Brown are no longer with the team, and the Cowboys traded for Brandin Cooks to help fill those vacancies. Cooks had a down year in 2022, but that can be attributed to playing in an ineffective offense and his desire to move on from the team. With Cooks joining the Cowboys, there is optimism that he can significantly upgrade the No. 2 receiver spot. Despite nearing the age plateau for receivers, last year's performance was likely an aberration, and if Cooks returns to his normal level of play, he can bring a boost to the passing game and provide a valuable complement to Lamb.

In 2022, the Dallas Cowboys saw a decline in Ezekiel Elliott's production, leading to a shift in their rushing attack. Elliott finished 43rd out of 48 qualifying running backs in rushing yards over expected per attempt and averaged just 3.9 yards per touch, significantly lower than Tony Pollard's impressive 5.9 mark. The backfield takes a hit without Ezekiel Elliott, dropping from sixth to 17th in the unit rankings. There's no proven depth behind Tony Pollard, but Pollard was phenomenal in 2022. He had more than 1,000 rushing yards, less than 400 receiving yards and twelve touchdowns. He was solid as a rock. With the hope of moving on from Elliott, the door is now open for Pollard to take over as the clear lead back. Throughout his career, Pollard has shown both increased touches and consistent efficiency per touch, making it a logical decision to give him more opportunities. However, the depth behind Pollard is a concern, with the team drafting Deuce Vaughn, signing Ronald Jones, and having Malik Davis on the depth chart. As a result, it won't be surprising if the Cowboys bring in a veteran closer to training camp to add further depth and competition.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, the Cowboys have the opportunity to establish Tony Pollard as their lead back and build the rushing offense around him. With Ezekiel Elliott's potential departure, Pollard can showcase his skills as a versatile and efficient runner. However, the lack of proven depth behind him remains a concern. The team's additions of Deuce Vaughn, Ronald Jones, and Malik Davis provide some options, but it wouldn't be surprising if the Cowboys seek a veteran presence to bolster their running back corps. Ultimately, the success of the rushing game will depend on Pollard's ability to handle an increased workload and the support he receives from the coaching staff and the remaining running backs on the roster.

In 2023, the Dallas Cowboys' defense is expected to have several strengths and areas of improvement. On the defensive line, Osa Odighizuwa and Chauncey Golston have shown promise, with Odighizuwa leading the interior in various categories and Golston being highly rated. The addition of Mazi Smith, the team's 27th overall pick, should provide stability and anchor the interior of the defensive line. The Cowboys' ability to create pressure on the quarterback is a significant strength, as they led the league in pressure rate and finished third in sacks. Micah Parsons, an impactful player entering his third season, consistently wreaks havoc on opposing quarterbacks and finished the previous season with impressive stats despite battling injuries. Demarcus Lawrence and Dorance Armstrong also contribute as effective pass rushers on the edge, and second-round rookie Sam Williams displayed promise with his pass-rushing abilities. Dante Fowler, after reuniting with defensive coordinator Dan Quinn, recorded a high pressure rate and contributed six sacks.

At linebacker, the Cowboys retained Leighton Vander Esch, providing experience and stability to the position. However, there is a lack of experience and depth beyond Vander Esch, and his absence could create a significant hole in the defense. Third-round pick DeMarvion Overshown, although lacking experience, is expected to bring talent and compete for playing time.

In the secondary, Trevon Diggs had a standout season with 11 interceptions in the previous year. While he had fewer interceptions in 2022, he showed improvement in yards per reception allowed. The addition of Stephon Gilmore adds to the solidity of the cornerback position, forming a solid duo alongside Diggs. Jourdan Lewis and DaRon Bland manned the slot corner positions in 2022, with Lewis outperforming Bland statistically. The Cowboys ranked well in EPA per play when opponents attempted deep passes of 20 or more air yards. Safety Malik Hooker had a resurgence, earning a solid ranking from PFF, and Jayron Kearse and Donovan Wilson provide good depth at the safety position.
