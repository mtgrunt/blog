## "Zenfone 10: Near Perfection."

What's going on? The Asus Zenfone 10 is a highly impressive smartphone that addresses the shortcomings of its predecessor while maintaining its core strengths. Packed with top-of-the-line features, this phone offers a compelling user experience. Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, it delivers outstanding performance and excellent battery life. Additionally, the inclusion of wireless charging resolves one of the minor criticisms of the previous model, making it a more versatile device.

Another improvement in the Zenfone 10 is the enhanced durability of its back material. The soft touch finish of the Zenfone 9, although pleasant to the touch, wore down quickly and easily accumulated marks. With a slightly different material in the Zenfone 10, Asus has addressed this issue, resulting in a more resilient and long-lasting back panel. The phone's sleek design, available in various color options, coupled with its durable construction, gives it an appealing aesthetic.

Asus has also upgraded the camera system in the Zenfone 10, providing better image stabilization and software zoom improvements. The primary 50-megapixel camera captures detailed and dynamic shots, while the improved hybrid gimbal stabilization system minimizes hand movements for sharper photos and shake-resistant videos. Although lacking a dedicated telephoto lens, the software zoom performs adequately for moderate magnification. Overall, the Zenfone 10's camera system is commendable, especially considering its non-flagship price range.

Display-wise, the Zenfone 10 boasts a 144Hz LTPO display that delivers smooth visuals, although it primarily operates at 120Hz in most scenarios. The power button on the side of the phone serves multiple functions, including fingerprint recognition, camera quick launch and a notification slider, adding convenience to the user experience. Furthermore, Asus's software customization options allow users to tailor the device to their preferences, striking a balance between stock Android and Asus's custom features.

One area where Asus could further improve the Zenfone 10 is in its software support. While the promised two years of updates are decent, a longer support period would ensure that users can enjoy the device's capabilities for a more extended period. Nevertheless, considering its competitive price point and the overall package it offers, the Asus Zenfone 10 stands out as a nearly perfect phone that excels in performance, durability, camera capabilities and user customization options.
