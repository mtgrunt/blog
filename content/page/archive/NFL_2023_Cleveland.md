The Cleveland Browns had a disappointing 7-10 season in 2022, and there were multiple factors that contributed to their struggles. The most obvious factor was the lack of production at the quarterback position. The passing attack ranked below average in EPA, success rate, and yards per attempt, and it didn't improve when Deshaun Watson joined the team in Week 12.

Another area of decline was the rushing attack, which was less efficient compared to the previous year. However, these issues were exacerbated by the incredibly difficult schedule the Browns faced in 2022, particularly when compared to the previous season.

In 2021, the Browns played against the 4th-easiest schedule of pass defenses and the 3rd-easiest schedule of run defenses. Playing against weaker defenses certainly helps an offense perform better. However, in 2022, the Browns faced the 4th-toughest schedule of pass defenses and the 2nd-toughest schedule of run defenses. The tables had turned, and the Browns were up against much stronger opponents.

They played 12 games against top-15 pass defenses, which was the second-most in the league, and 10 games against top-15 run defenses, tied for the most in the NFL. While one could argue that their struggles were due to the difficult schedule, a closer look at their performance against good and bad defenses reveals a problem.

When facing top-15 pass defenses, the Browns' passing attack had a -0.02 EPA/attempt, a 43.8% success rate, and 7.1 yards per attempt. Against all other defenses, their numbers were still below average at -0.02 EPA/attempt, a 44.7% success rate, and 6.7 yards per attempt. These statistics indicate that the Browns' passing offense was below average even against weaker defenses.

The story was similar for the rushing attack. Against top-15 run defenses, the Browns had a -0.04 EPA/attempt, a 38.5% success rate, and 4.4 yards per carry. Against all other defenses, their numbers were slightly better but still below average at -0.00 EPA/attempt, a 38.7% success rate, and 4.9 yards per carry.

Looking ahead to 2023, there is some good news for the Browns. Their schedule is projected to be less challenging for their passing attack, facing the 15th-toughest pass defenses compared to the 4th-toughest in 2022. However, they are projected to face the 3rd-toughest schedule of run defenses, similar to what they faced last year.

While it might be tempting to attribute the Browns' struggles solely to their tough schedule, there are deeper issues to consider. The primary reason for their struggles was the poor production from their passing attack. However, it's important to understand the team's strategy and philosophy.

Under head coach Kevin Stefanski, the Browns prioritize running the ball. Their run-centric approach was evident in their play-calling and personnel usage. The Browns ranked low in early down pass rates and first down pass rates, consistently favoring the running game.

One significant change in the Browns' offensive personnel was the absence of Austin Hooper in 2022. Despite playing the most snaps among skill players in 2021, Hooper's performance was underwhelming, leading to his release. The Browns expected Harrison Bryant to step up and fill the void, but he struggled in both receiving and run blocking.

The reliance on 2-TE sets decreased in 2022, impacting the effectiveness of the run game. The numbers show that Nick Chubb's rushing statistics were worse when running with 2+ TEs on the field in 2022 compared to 2021. This drop in efficiency can be attributed to the Browns' decreased usage of 2+ TE sets and the subpar performance of their TE2.

The Browns' miscalculations with their TE situation had a significant impact on their offensive production. The team may be forced to rely more on 11 personnel (one tight end, one running back, and three wide receivers) due to the lack of a reliable TE2 option.

In terms of coaching, there are some concerns about Kevin Stefanski's strategies, decision-making, and play-calling. The Browns had a noticeable drop in first-down passing rates, despite the running game being substantially worse in 2022. This decision to lean heavily into the run game didn't make sense given the decline in rushing efficiency.

Additionally, the Browns underutilized play action, which had proven to be more successful than traditional dropbacks. Increasing the play action rate and finding a better balance on early downs could significantly improve the offense's performance.

Despite these challenges, the Browns still have a talented roster, and there is belief in the coaching staff. To be competitive in 2023, they need improved production from their TE2, a better balance on early downs, an increased emphasis on play action, improved efficiency in 11 personnel, and a return to form for Deshaun Watson.

The Cleveland Browns made a significant investment in Deshaun Watson, trading for him last offseason and signing him to a long-term contract. However, Watson's performance in 2022 was underwhelming, with a career-low completion percentage and declining efficiency metrics. The Browns will be looking for a bounce-back season from Watson and a more productive passing attack considering their investment in him.

The Browns had success in the receiving corps in 2022, particularly with the addition of Amari Cooper, who proved to be an underrated pickup. Cooper had a career-high in targets and averaged 14.9 yards per reception. Donovan Peoples-Jones also made contributions as a full-time wide receiver. David Njoku had a career-high in yards per game and caught a high percentage of his targets. The return of these three players, along with the additions of Elijah Moore via trade and Cedric Tillman through the draft, gives the Browns a solid receiving corps for 2023.

Cleveland remained one of the league's best rushing teams in 2022. Nick Chubb had a standout season, posting career-highs in several categories and maintaining his impressive yards per carry average. With Kareem Hunt no longer on the roster, Chubb may see an increased workload, but the Browns also drafted Jerome Ford in the fifth round, who could have a larger role behind Chubb. Despite some changes in the depth chart, the Browns' rushing attack is expected to remain strong in 2023.

Browns made some additions to their defense, including signing Dalvin Tomlinson, who excels in run defense. However, the Browns will be looking for more production from their pass rushers, particularly outside of Myles Garrett, who was one of the league's best in that regard. Linebacker depth was an issue due to injuries, but the Browns still played with three linebackers on the field at a high rate. Changes in defensive coordinator may lead to adjustments in personnel usage. In the secondary, Denzel Ward had an inconsistent season, and there is room for improvement. Grant Delpit had a breakout season and is expected to continue making positive contributions. Overall, the Browns have a solid defensive group but will need improved performance in certain areas.

Wide receiver Cedric Tillman has the potential to contribute and could provide depth in the receiving corps. Siaki Ika, a nose tackle, may face challenges due to the changing value of the position but could still make an impact in run defense. Offensive tackle Dawand Jones has the potential to be a steal in the fourth round and could provide depth and potential starter-quality play. Other draft picks, including Isaiah McGuire, Dorian Thompson-Robinson, and Cameron Mitchell, have the opportunity to compete for playing time and contribute to the team's success. Despite limited capital, the Browns made the most of their draft selections and have prospects who could make an impact in the near future.

While there are concerns, there is optimism that the Browns can address these issues and bounce back in the upcoming season. However, improvement will require a closer examination of their offensive strategies, decision-making, and play calling.
