2022 was another disappointing season for the New York Jets, continuing their decade-long struggle to find success. The team's quarterback situation has been abysmal, with a string of ineffective and inconsistent players leading the offense. The last Jets quarterback to have a winning record was Mark Sanchez, a decade ago. Since then, the team has had a revolving door of quarterbacks, resulting in a dismal record.

On the other hand, the Jets' defense has consistently performed well over the past decade, ranking in the top 10 in success rate and yards per play allowed. In seven of the last ten years, the defense has been among the best in the league. However, the offense has been the worst in the NFL, ranking last in EPA/play, success rate and yards per play. The lack of offensive production has been the main reason for the team's struggles.

Despite the strong defense, the Jets have failed to make a single trip to the playoffs due to their poor quarterback play. The team's ownership recognized this issue and made a big move to address it by acquiring Aaron Rodgers, one of the top quarterbacks in the league. The Jets and their fans are excited about this acquisition, and the NFL has scheduled primetime games to showcase Rodgers and the team early in the season.

Looking back at the 2022 season, the Jets' offense continued to struggle, but there was a noticeable improvement in the defense under head coach Robert Saleh. The defense showed significant progress in various metrics, especially when facing top-10 offenses. They ranked highly in yards per play allowed, EPA/dropback allowed, success rate allowed, and other key defensive statistics.

However, the offense, led by quarterback Zach Wilson, faced numerous challenges. Wilson struggled with accuracy, judgment, and processing, resulting in a low completion percentage and poor decision-making. The running game also underperformed, partly due to injuries to key players.

In 2023, the Jets hope to address some of their offensive shortcomings. The addition of wide receivers Allen Lazard, Mecole Hardman, Garrett Wilson and Corey Davis should provide more options for the passing game. If the team can establish efficiency in their 3WR sets, it could positively impact the running game as well. The Jets' offensive line, running back corps, and quarterback room were among the most injured in the league, so improved health could make a significant difference.

Despite their offensive struggles, the Jets were surprisingly competitive at times in 2022. They were in playoff contention during various points in the season, showcasing the potential of their improved defense. However, they ultimately fell short.

The Jets made a bold move with their first-round pick, selecting Will McDonald IV. While McDonald didn't rank highly in pressure rate generated on the edge in the Big 12, his versatility and pass-rushing potential make him an intriguing prospect. He will have a year to learn and develop behind Carl Lawson before potentially taking over as the starting edge rusher.

In the second round, the Jets drafted Joe Tippman, who will compete for the starting center position against Connor McGovern. Tippman will need to adjust to a zone-heavy blocking scheme, but he has the potential to become the starting center. Overall, the Jets' 2023 draft class may not have immediate impact players, but they have the potential to contribute and develop over time.

The Jets' passing offense struggled in 2022, ranking near the bottom of the league in various metrics. However, with the acquisition of Aaron Rodgers, there is renewed hope for the passing game. Rodgers, despite a slightly down year in 2022, is still considered one of the best quarterbacks in the league. With improved weapons such as Garrett Wilson, Allen Lazard, Mecole Hardman and Randall Cobb, the passing offense has the potential for a significant upgrade in 2023.

Garrett Wilson, the Jets' first-round pick in 2022, had an outstanding rookie season, leading all rookies in receiving yards and winning the Rookie of the Year award. Alongside Wilson, the Jets added Allen Lazard, who had a career-best season in 2022, and veterans Mecole Hardman and Randall Cobb. With Corey Davis and Denzel Mims still on the roster, the Jets have a solid group of receivers that can provide playmaking ability and depth for Aaron Rodgers in 2023.

The Jets' rushing game in 2022 was led by Breece Hall, the team's first-round pick last year. Hall showcased explosiveness and versatility before suffering a season-ending ACL injury. In 2023, the Jets will rely on Hall's recovery and hope he can regain his form. They also drafted Israel Abanikanda, who will compete for the backup role behind Hall. The Jets will look for improvement in their overall rushing production and hope to establish a more effective ground game.

New York' defense has shown significant improvement in recent years, with players like Quinnen Williams, Carl Lawson, and Sauce Gardner leading the way. Quinnen Williams is a standout defensive lineman, while Lawson provides a strong pass rush presence. Sauce Gardner had an exceptional rookie season and solidified himself as one of the top cornerbacks in the league. The Jets' defense has the potential to be one of the best in the league, especially if players like Jermaine Johnson and Will McDonald IV step up and contribute.

Looking ahead to 2023, the Jets face a tough schedule of offenses once again but benefit from rest edges provided by the NFL. These rest edges can be crucial, especially as the season progresses and injuries take a toll on teams. The Jets have the best net rest edge in the league, with 12 more days of rest than their opponents. This advantage could play a significant role in their success.

In summary, the Jets have been plagued by a decade of poor quarterback play, hindering their chances of making the playoffs. However, with the acquisition of Aaron Rodgers and improvements on defense, there is hope for a better future. The team's strong defense and rest edges provided by the NFL give them a competitive advantage in the 2023 season. With improved offensive production and a favorable schedule, the Jets could finally break their playoff drought and bring excitement back to New York football.
