The 2023 Tampa Bay Buccaneers faced a multitude of struggles and frustrations over the past couple of years. They seemed to be stuck in the past, clinging to outdated beliefs about the game that existed in the 90s. Additionally, they appeared to be out of touch with modern data and optimization techniques. An anecdote from the NFC South Championship Game in Week 17 highlighted their questionable decision-making. Despite the passing game being more effective on first downs, the Buccaneers relied heavily on running plays, which averaged just 3.3 yards per carry.

The offensive line's performance was a concern, as they ranked poorly in both pass block win rate and run block win rate. The only saving grace was Tom Brady's ability to release the ball quickly, which helped mask some of the unit's deficiencies. Brady's quick decision-making and release time allowed him to have the fastest time to throw in the league, with only 16% of his dropbacks lasting three or more seconds.

Financially, the Buccaneers faced challenges with the largest dead cap allocation, limiting their ability to upgrade the roster. They also had a tough schedule, facing three formidable opponents in the Bills, 49ers, and Eagles, who were all among the top five in Super Bowl odds.

The team experienced a significant decline in various unit rankings, including a drastic drop in quarterback rankings after transitioning from Tom Brady to Baker Mayfield and Kyle Trask. Mayfield, in particular, had a poor performance last year, ranking near the bottom in several statistical categories. The running back position also struggled, with Rachaad White failing to provide explosive plays and the team ranking poorly in yards per carry, carries for 10 or more yards, and yards created after contact.

The offensive line's decline was evident, and even Brady's quick passes couldn't fully mask their shortcomings. On a positive note, the team had some promising young building blocks in Tristan Wirfs, Luke Goedeke, and Cody Mauch.

The front seven of the defense received mixed rankings, with varying opinions on their performance. The pass rush was inconsistent, and there were concerns about the depth in the secondary. Carlton Davis, Jamel Dean, and Antoine Winfield Jr. anchored a solid secondary, but injuries and a lack of depth posed challenges. Overall, the defense struggled to generate pressure on opposing quarterbacks, with a declining pressure rate in recent years.

The 2023 draft class brought some hope for the Buccaneers, particularly with the addition of Calijah Kancey, a disruptive interior defender, in the first round. He is a stud.They also acquired YaYa Diaby, an undersized interior pass rusher, and Cody Mauch, who would compete for a starting job on the offensive line. Other draft picks added depth and potential for the future.

The passing game suffered a major setback in 2022, with poor rankings in yards per pass attempt and yards per completed pass. With the departure of Brady, the Buccaneers found themselves in quarterback uncertainty, bringing in Baker Mayfield and Kyle Trask to compete for the starting position. Mayfield's performance in recent years has been disappointing, while Trask has limited NFL experience. The team's passing attack led in targets and receptions but struggled in yards per catch and yards per route run. The running game was one of the worst in the league, ranking poorly in various metrics. Leonard Fournette was released, further complicating the situation.

Financially, the Buccaneers faced challenges with a high cash spending in previous years, resulting in reduced spending in 2023. The team also had a significant dead cap, limiting their flexibility. The addition of Mayfield and the expected last-place finish in the NFC South raised concerns about their quarterback situation.

On the defensive side, the Buccaneers struggled to generate pressure on opposing quarterbacks, with declining pressure rates in recent years. There were concerns about the pass rush on the edge, with Shaq Barrett's limited playing time and inconsistency from Joe Tryon-Shoyinka. Lavonte David and Devin White remained strong at the linebacker position, while Jamel Dean was an underrated cornerback. However, there were questions about the depth in the secondary.

Looking ahead to the start of the season, the Buccaneers would face a mix of veteran quarterbacks in the first eight weeks, including Josh Allen, Kirk Cousins, Jalen Hurts, Derek Carr, Jared Goff and Justin Fields.

Overall, the Buccaneers faced numerous challenges and uncertainties heading into the 2023 season. They struggled with outdated approaches, financial limitations and concerns in various positions. The team would need to address these issues and find ways to overcome their struggles to compete in the NFC South.
