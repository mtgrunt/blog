The Pittsburgh Steelers exceeded expectations in the 2022 season, regardless of the opinions regarding their head coach, Mike Tomlin. Under Tomlin's leadership, the team has maintained a remarkable streak of 16 consecutive years without a losing season, a feat unmatched by any other team in the NFL. Additionally, the Steelers have covered the point spread at the fourth-highest rate over the past decade, demonstrating their consistent ability to exceed expectations.

However, critics of Tomlin point out that the team has not won a playoff game in six years, with their last playoff victory occurring in 2016. This has led to debates about whether it is preferable to support a team that consistently performs well but fails to win a Super Bowl or a team that occasionally has magical Super Bowl runs despite fewer overall victories.

It is worth noting that over the past three years, the Steelers have had the third-most wins in the AFC, trailing only the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills. They have also been one of the four teams in the NFL to have winning seasons in each of the last three years, along with the Chiefs, Bills, and Miami Dolphins.

Comparing the Steelers' performance to other teams, the Steelers have had fewer losing seasons in the last decade than many other teams in the league. They have consistently maintained a competitive record, even in seasons where they fell short of making the playoffs.

Even in the 2022 season, when the Steelers finished with a winning record but missed the playoffs, they were involved in close games. Out of their 17 games, 14 were decided by one score or less, indicating that they were competitive throughout the season. They only suffered significant losses against the Super Bowl runner-up Philadelphia Eagles, the Buffalo Bills, and the Cleveland Browns.

To further support the argument that the Steelers exceeded expectations in 2022, three key statistics can be considered. Firstly, the team was projected to win 7.5 games but won 9, surpassing their projected win total. Secondly, they were initially favored in only four games but ended up being favored in six games, winning four of them. This improvement in their power rating relative to their opponents reflects their ability to exceed expectations. Finally, the Steelers had a 62.5% cover rate against the spread, which was the sixth-best in the league. This indicates that they consistently performed better than expected, as covering spreads implies exceeding expectations.

It is important to recognize that these expectations are not subjective but are based on the assessments of the betting market, which is known for its accuracy in predicting outcomes. The lines are set by knowledgeable bookmakers who adjust them to minimize their own financial risks. Therefore, when a team outperforms the expectations set by the betting market, it can be concluded that they have vastly exceeded expectations.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, the Steelers face several key challenges. One of the main areas of focus will be their offensive line, which performed better than anticipated in 2022 but still had room for improvement. The development of young players like tackle Dan Moore and center Mason Cole will be crucial in solidifying the offensive line's performance.

The success of the running game will also be important, especially considering the Steelers faced a tough schedule of run defenses in 2022. Despite the challenging matchups, the rushing attack showed improvement, achieving better efficiency and success compared to the previous year. However, the team will need to address the predictability of their runs and work on creating more explosive plays.

Quarterback Kenny Pickett, who took over the starting role during the season, showed promise but will need to improve his performance on early downs and downfield passing. While he excelled on third downs in the latter part of the season, sustaining that level of success can be challenging. The chemistry between Pickett and wide receiver Diontae Johnson needs to improve, and the team must find ways to generate more explosive plays and improve their play-action game. Kenny Pickett started 12 games for the Steelers, helping them win five of their final six games. However, Pickett's performance left room for improvement. He ranked 23rd out of 33 qualified quarterbacks in expected points per dropback and completion rate, and 32nd in yards per pass attempt. Touchdown production was also lacking, with Pickett posting a low touchdown rate of 1.8%. Moving forward, Pickett will need to work on his efficiency and downfield passing to elevate the team's passing game.

Diontae Johnson set an NFL record for the most targets in a season (147) without a touchdown reception in 2022. The team added rookie George Pickens, who showed promise as the fourth-ranked rookie wide receiver in targets, catches, and receiving yards. Tight end Pat Freiermuth also saw improvement in his second year. The Steelers acquired Allen Robinson, hoping for a resurgence after a down year with the Rams. The team will need better production and more scoring from their receiving corps in 2023.

The Steelers' rushing attack lacked explosiveness in 2022, ranking 26th in yards per carry and struggling to generate yards before and after contact. Despite a strong finish to the season, rookie running back Najee Harris lacked efficiency, ranking 24th in EPA per rush and yards before contact per carry. Jaylen Warren provided a spark with a higher yards per carry average and success rate on his limited carries. The Steelers will look to improve the overall performance and explosiveness of their run game in 2023.

On the defensive side, Cam Heyward remains a dominant force, leading the team in positive tackles and quarterback hits. Larry Ogunjobi signed a three-year deal and brings solid play to the defensive line. T.J. Watt, one of the league's top pass rushers, battled injuries in 2022 but still ranked high in pass rush win rate. Alex Highsmith showcased his ability to get to the quarterback and force turnovers. The Steelers made changes to their linebacking corps, bringing in Cole Holcomb and Elandon Roberts. The secondary added Patrick Peterson and Levi Wallace, while young talents like Joey Porter Jr. and Minkah Fitzpatrick continue to excel. Damontae Kazee is expected to take on a bigger role with the departure of Terrell Edmunds. The defense has strong playmakers but will need to maintain consistency and improve in certain areas to be even more formidable in 2023.

The Steelers' draft class includes several key additions who are expected to make immediate impacts. First-round pick Broderick Jones will compete for the starting left tackle job, bringing improvements to the offensive line. Second-round pick Joey Porter Jr. showed improvement in college and has the potential to be disruptive in the secondary. Keeanu Benton, also a second-round pick, brings athleticism to the defensive line and can play multiple roles. Third-round pick Darnell Washington is a strong blocker and will contribute as the second tight end. Fourth-round pick Nick Herbig provides depth at edge rusher behind T.J. Watt. Late-round picks Cory Trice Jr. and Spencer Anderson have potential to develop into larger roles. Overall, the Steelers' draft class addresses needs and adds valuable depth to the team for the upcoming season.

In summary, the Pittsburgh Steelers exceeded expectations in the 2022 season, demonstrated by their record, point spread performance, and cover rate. Despite the lack of recent playoff success, the team has been consistently competitive and has outperformed many other teams in the league. Heading into the 2023 season, they will need to address key areas of improvement to build on their success and make a stronger push in the playoffs.
