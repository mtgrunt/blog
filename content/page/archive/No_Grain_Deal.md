## "No Grain Deal."

The situation revolves around whether Putin will agree to extend a grain export deal with Turkey due to other transactions he wants to conduct with them. However, the prospects for an extension do not appear promising, evidenced by recent actions taken by Russia. One such action was the vetoing of a long-running cross-border aid operation from Turkey into opposition-held parts of Syria. This move signals Russian unhappiness with certain actions by Turkey, leading to the closure of the aid operation.

Russia has been engaging in aggressive actions, including seizing ships in the Black Sea and bombarding Ukrainian grain facilities for several consecutive days. These actions are seen as attempts to pressure Western nations into dropping sanctions. The UN has warned that such attacks could lead to millions being at risk of hunger and starvation. Thus, it could cause food prices to rise.

The grain export deal in question has been running successfully for about a year, allowing 32 million tons of Ukrainian wheat and maize to reach the global grain market. This has been crucial for countries threatened by famine, with the UN's World Food Program purchasing a significant portion of the grain to aid those in need.

The reason Russia wants to close down this deal is likely multifaceted. One reason is to exert pressure on Ukraine and profit from other potential transactions. Moreover, Russia may be expressing its displeasure with Turkey over recent issues, such as Turkey's acquiescence to Sweden joining NATO and the release of Ukrainian soldiers held in Turkey.

As for potential key players in resolving the situation, President Putin holds significant influence, but President Erdogan of Turkey may also play a crucial role. Turkey and Russia have significant ties and the outcome of the grain export deal may depend on other transactions between them.

However, the prospects for a positive resolution seem slim, given Russia's recent actions and the UN's concerns about potential targeting of civilian vessels in the Black Sea. Many countries in the Middle East, Asia and Africa are unhappy about the situation, but their ability to exert significant pressure on Russia is limited. This situation could escalate tensions and have far-reaching geopolitical implications.

In conclusion, the question of extending the grain export deal depends on various factors, including Russia's interests and displeasure with other nations' actions. The situation's complexity and Russia's recent aggressive actions make it uncertain whether a resolution can be reached and the repercussions could have serious humanitarian and geopolitical implications.
