## "Advancing Ukrainian Offensive"
#### _07/05/2023_ 
____
A senior Ukrainian official has expressed optimism about the country's counter-offensive against Russian forces, stating that they have made significant progress in recent days. The Ukrainian strategy involves stretching the Russians and looking for gaps in their defenses to break up their shape. There are three areas of interest on the front lines, with particular attention focused on Bachmann, the center, and the crossing of the Danipa River at Kirsten and Novakovka.

In the south, the Ukrainians are making real progress, engaging in intense fighting and pushing the Russians back. The Russians are responding by potentially bringing in reserves to halt this offensive. The center, running from Silka through to Oricu, is of utmost importance as it leads to Top Mac and eventually Melitopol on the coast. However, the Ukrainians have yet to face the main defensive lines that General Sullivan, despite his disappearance in Moscow, had set up. Meeting these defenses will be a critical challenge for the Ukrainian forces.

Moreover, the Ukrainians have opened up a third front by crossing the Danipa River at Kirsten and Novakovka. The Russians are now attempting to counter-attack in response. The Ukrainian forces are stretching the Russians further west than anticipated, taking advantage of the drying out of previously flooded areas. These three fronts appear to be the main focus of the Ukrainian offensive.

However, the Russians are not sitting idle. There are reports of Russian concentrations around Crimea, particularly near the city of Kerch. The Russians nearly lost Crimea before, but they managed to hold on and now they seem to be building up significant troop numbers, potentially reaching tens of thousands. The exact strength and equipment quality remain uncertain, but the Russians are likely preparing for their own counter-offensive to reclaim areas lost in Crimea last summer. While the Ukrainians concentrate on their push, they may soon face another offensive from the Russians.

In addition, the Ukrainians have yet to deploy their formidable nine armor Brigade, which has been prepared for this offensive. The media blackout in Kiev suggests that something significant may be underway, possibly signaling the mobilization of the big nine. This could further tip the balance in the ongoing conflict. As both sides make strategic moves and continue their military operations, the situation remains highly dynamic and unpredictable.
