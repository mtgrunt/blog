## "Ode to the Coliseum."

Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball (MLB), faced criticism and defended his earlier comments regarding the Oakland Athletics' proposed move to Las Vegas. Manfred stated that one big turnout by A's fans does not erase a "decade worth of inaction" by the team. He clarified that his initial comment expressing sympathy for the fans was taken out of context. Manfred mentioned that the A's had not submitted a relocation application and there is no set deadline for clubs to vote on the move.

During an owners meeting, Manfred sarcastically praised the A's turnout, stating that it was almost an average MLB crowd. The approval process for the Athletics' relocation to Las Vegas is set to begin, involving a relocation committee and a vote by MLB team owners. Manfred stated that he has not appointed any additional members to the relocation committee and that the timeline for the process depends on when the application is submitted.

The Oakland A's have been struggling with low attendance, averaging under 10,000 fans per home game, the lowest among all MLB teams. The proposed move to Las Vegas includes a $1.5 billion, 30,000-seat ballpark near the Las Vegas Strip. The A's have already cleared some major hurdles, including securing $380 million in public financing and obtaining an agreement for the land. However, the move still requires approval from MLB team owners.

On the other side, Oakland Coliseum was a trip to remember – in the 1990’s. Don’t start with me about John Fisher, the owner of the Oakland A's baseball team, perceived indifference towards the team and its fans. It’s Fisher's lack of visibility and involvement in the team's affairs over the past 15 years, allowing others to take the blame for unpopular decisions. Fisher's sensed cheapness and lack of investment in the team, which has resulted in a reputation for being financially restrained. It’s just like Cleveland Indians in Major League film, but at last, Athletics are last in the league.  

I question Fisher's motives and integrity as an owner, emphasizing the impact of his cost-cutting decisions on loyal employees and minor leaguers. They argue that Fisher's actions undermine trust and goodwill within the organization and the community, especially considering the team's pursuit of a new stadium. John Fisher as an anonymous and disconnected owner who prioritizes cost-cutting over the well-being of the team and its employees. They criticize his lack of transparency, perceived insincerity, and the negative impact of his decisions, leaving a lasting negative impression and causing them to question their loyalty to the team. 

In a separate discussion, Brodie Brazil, a commentator, talked about the situation and suggested that the mayor's office in Oakland should take advantage of the current spotlight on the city. He proposed that they clearly articulate what a "yes" deal from Oakland would look like, emphasizing the site plan for Howard Terminal, the financial plan with infrastructure funding, a timeline for construction, and potential options for the Coliseum site. Brazil highlighted the importance of using the current attention to present Oakland's best offer and intentions to keep the team in the city. Brodie Brazil was the one who clarify the situation.  

Overall, the comments from Rob Manfred and the discussion by Brodie Brazil shed light on the ongoing debate surrounding the potential relocation of the Oakland A's to Las Vegas. The commissioner acknowledged the fans' disappointment while defending his previous remarks, and Brazil suggested that the city of Oakland should seize the opportunity to outline a clear plan and make their case for keeping the team. The situation remains uncertain, but I think it’s goodbye to A’s staying in Oakland.
