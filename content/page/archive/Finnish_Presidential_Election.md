Pekka Haavisto of the Greens emerged as the clear favorite among the public during the initial round of voting, securing 31 percent of the vote, a notable 12 percentage points ahead of the runner-up, Alexander Stubb from the NCP.

Tuomo Turja, the research director at Taloustutkimus, highlighted Haavisto's widespread support, especially from his own party, the Greens, as well as backing from the Social Democrats, Left Alliance, and Swedish People’s Party. Haavisto enjoyed the highest level of popularity among supporters of these four parties.

In the same round of voting, Olli Rehn from the Centre Party received 11 percent of the vote, Mika Aaltola 10 percent, Jussi Halla-aho of the PS secured nine percent, Li Andersson from the Left Alliance received six percent, and Jutta Urpilainen of the SDP garnered five percent of the respondents' support.

The poll indicated that Stubb's popularity had the potential to grow among right-leaning and centrist voters in the second round of voting. For instance, more than half of Centre Party supporters expressed their willingness to support the former prime minister in a hypothetical runoff against Haavisto.

However, it was noted that Haavisto faced opposition, particularly from the Finns Party. Surprisingly, 69 percent of Finns Party supporters indicated their potential backing for Stubb in such a scenario, despite him not being their ideal candidate.

Taloustutkimus conducted the poll, which gathered 1,507 responses between September 8 and 11.

The first round of the presidential elections is scheduled to conclude on January 28, 2024, with a possible second round slated for February 11.
