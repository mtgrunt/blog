Four teams to watch.         
    
Baltimore Ravens 4-2:
In the Baltimore Ravens' Week 7 matchup against the Lions, this indicates that the Ravens' success in the game might heavily depend on their ability to exploit the Lions' defensive scheme. A highlight is the strategic battle between these two teams in this matchup, Ravens' offensive line and Lions' defensive line. When facing man coverage, the Ravens showcased their offensive prowess, ranking 10th in EPA (Expected Points Added) per attempt. Their ability to exploit individual matchups and create separation was evident.  However, it was a different story when confronted with zone coverage, where they struggled significantly ranking 30th in EPA per attempt. 
    
Seattle Seahawks 3-2:
In the 2023 NFL season, the Seattle Seahawks found themselves in a pivotal situation in Week 7. Fresh off a challenging road loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, they are gearing up to face the Arizona Cardinals. Although the Cardinals were punching above their weight, the Seahawks recognized this as an opportunity to rebound and secure a much-needed victory. The Cardinals might be far from playoff contention, but the Seahawks were well aware of their resilience. Arizona's head coach, Jonathan Gannon, who consistently inspired his team to give their all each week. Despite their 1-5 record, the Seahawks knew that this season was far from over. Cardinals had managed to claim a victory against the formidable Dallas Cowboys, a testament to their potential to compete with top-tier teams in the league. With a home game against the Cardinals on the horizon, the Seahawks were determined to capitalize on this matchup before the schedule presented more formidable challenges.
    
Cleveland Browns 3-2:
I was shocked over the win against the 49ers. Through five games, the Browns had achieved a remarkable milestone, allowing only 1,002 yards of offense, a feat that hadn't been seen in the league since 1971. Their dominance extended to the rate of three-and-out drives, with an astounding 59.4% of opposing offenses failing to sustain drives against them, making it the highest rate in the league, well above the league average of 33.6%. Furthermore, the Browns' defense had been particularly stingy on third and long situations, where they held the Indianapolis Colts to a mere 8.8% conversion rate. Gardner Minshew had made a significant impact in his two starts consistently performing as QB22 in both weeks, showcasing the Browns' depth and versatility as they continued to make strides in the 2023 season.
   
Philadelphia Eagles 5-1: 
In the 2023 NFL season, the Philadelphia Eagles found themselves in an intriguing matchup in Week 7 on Sunday Night Football. While the Eagles had started the season strong, their first loss may have ignited a sense of urgency within the team. There were some concerns that the 2023 Eagles might not be the same formidable force they were in the previous year. One of the main points of contention was whether the Eagles had the necessary speed in their defensive backfield to effectively contain the high-powered Miami Dolphins offense. The Dolphins had been making waves and were particularly adept at exploiting the deep ball. With this in mind, many anticipated a thrilling showdown between two of the NFL's best teams. The clash between head coaches Nick Sirianni and Mike McDaniel added an extra layer of intrigue to the matchup. It was worth noting that the Miami Dolphins faced the third-hardest schedule in the league in 2023, making their road victory against the Eagles all the more impressive in a season filled with challenges.
