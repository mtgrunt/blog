The Baltimore Ravens have been led by their star quarterback, Lamar Jackson, who signed a five-year, $260 million contract with the team in the offseason. Jackson's career started in 2018 when he was inserted as the starter in Week 11, and he led the Ravens to a 6-1 record to close the season. In 2019, Jackson led the team to a 13-2 record as a starter, the best in the NFL, with their only losses coming against the Chiefs and the Browns. In 2020, the Ravens went 11-4 with Jackson as the starter, losing to the Chiefs, Titans, Patriots, and Steelers.

In 2021, Jackson led the Ravens to an 8-3 record to start the season, but he got injured, and the team lost every game without him, missing the playoffs for the first time since drafting Jackson. In 2022, the Ravens started the season with an 8-4 record and were the #3 seed in the AFC, but once again, Jackson got injured, and the team lost most of their games without him, dropping out of the #3 seed. Overall, Jackson has an impressive record of 45-15 as a starter when not injured mid-game, with 11 of those 15 losses being by one score or less.

One of the challenges the Ravens have faced is the lack of investment in wide receivers. The team has ranked low in spending on wide receivers, choosing to prioritize other areas of their roster. They have relied on young and inexpensive options, which has affected their passing game and limited Jackson's development as a passer. However, in the 2023 offseason, the Ravens made moves to address this issue by signing Odell Beckham Jr. and drafting Zay Flowers in the first round, providing more talent and diversity to their receiving corps.

The Ravens also made changes to their coaching staff, hiring Todd Monken as their offensive coordinator. Monken's hiring is expected to bring significant changes to the offense and help improve their performance in critical areas. In recent years, the Ravens have struggled with their opening drive and first-quarter touchdown rates, which have declined steadily. Monken's arrival and the addition of more talent at wide receiver should help the team prioritize building quick leads and improve their performance in the red zone.

The Ravens faced challenges in their passing game in 2022, especially when Lamar Jackson was injured and Tyler Huntley had to step in. Their passing yards per game and efficiency ranked among the lowest in the league during that stretch. However, the team has made significant changes for 2023 by hiring Todd Monken as offensive coordinator and adding playmakers like Odell Beckham and Zay Flowers to the receiving corps. These additions, along with the return of Rashod Bateman and the presence of tight end Mark Andrews, should provide Lamar Jackson with more weapons and improve the passing attack.

In 2022, the Ravens' wide receivers struggled to make an impact, with only one touchdown catch by the group in the final 14 games. Rashod Bateman's return from injury and the additions of Odell Beckham, Zay Flowers and Nelson Agholor should provide a significant boost to the receiving corps in 2023. The team also has a strong tight end group led by Mark Andrews. With improved talent and depth at the wide receiver position, the Ravens expect their passing game to be more effective and explosive in the upcoming season.

Despite facing injuries in the backfield in 2022, the Ravens still had a solid rushing game. Their running backs averaged the highest yards per carry in the league and had a high rate of runs resulting in first downs or touchdowns. With J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards fully healthy for the 2023 season, along with the return of Lamar Jackson's dynamic rushing ability, the Ravens are poised to continue their strong ground attack. The combination of talented running backs and Jackson's mobility will make their rushing game a significant threat to opposing defenses.

The Ravens' defense showed improvement in 2022, ranking higher in defensive efficiency and early down defense compared to the previous year. The defensive line, led by players like Justin Madubuike and Odafe Oweh, showed promise in generating pressure on the quarterback. The addition of Roquan Smith at linebacker has had a positive impact on the overall defense, as he has been a productive playmaker. The secondary, anchored by Marlon Humphrey, remains strong. However, there are questions about the depth and talent at certain positions. Overall, the Ravens' defense has the potential to continue its upward trajectory and be a formidable unit in 2023.

Defensively, the Ravens showed improvement in 2022 under defensive coordinator Mike MacDonald, moving up in defensive efficiency and early down defense rankings. However, they face a tough schedule of opposing offenses in 2023, which will pose a challenge. Additionally, injuries have been a concern for the Ravens in recent years, and they need to avoid significant injuries if they want to compete with the top teams in the AFC.

The Ravens' draft class in 2023 addressed various needs on both sides of the ball. First-round pick Paris Johnson, an offensive lineman, is expected to be a key part of the team's future. Second-round pick BJ Ojulari brings immediate contributions as an edge rusher. Other picks like Garrett Williams, Kei'Trel Clark, Michael Wilson, Jon Gaines, Clayton Tune, Owen Pappoe and Dante Stills provide depth and potential impact in their respective positions. The draft class, coupled with the team's existing talent, adds depth and competition to the roster, setting the stage for a promising 2023 season.

Despite the challenges, the Ravens are projected to win 9.5 games in 2023 and have a favorable schedule, including games against teams with new quarterbacks. They have a late bye week, which will help them prepare for a tough closing stretch. Overall, the Ravens have the potential to compete for a playoff spot and make a deep postseason run if they can stay healthy and improve their performance in key areas of the game.
