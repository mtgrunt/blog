The Denver Broncos' 2022 season was a tale of two sides, with their defense shining brightly while their offense struggled immensely, mainly due to Russell Wilson's lackluster performance. The defense demonstrated its brilliance through Week 10, holding opponents to fewer points than projected in all but one game and allowing an average of only 16.6 points per game. This elite defensive performance was a rare occurrence, with only six other instances in the last 35 years where a team achieved such a feat.

Through Week 15, the Broncos' defense continued to impress, ranking highly in various metrics like EPA/play, success rate, and yards/play. However, as the season wore on, the defense began to falter, especially in the last three weeks. The once dominant unit experienced a decline in efficiency, struggling to generate pressure on opposing quarterbacks and conceding higher rates of red zone conversions and touchdowns per drive.

On the other hand, Russell Wilson's individual statistics for the 2022 season were subpar, recording his lowest passing touchdowns, highest number of sacks, and second-highest interceptions in his career. His completion rate, EPA/dropback, success rate, first down rate per attempt, and third-down conversion rate were also at career lows. Even when removing sacks from his metrics, Wilson's performance was dismal, ranking poorly in multiple categories.

Despite playing against one of the easiest pass defense schedules, the Broncos' offensive woes persisted throughout the season. Their struggles were evident in third downs within field goal range, where their conversion rate was the worst in the NFL. A more average performance in this area could have turned several losses into victories.

With the addition of Sean Payton as the new head coach, there is hope for improvement in the 2023 season. Payton's coaching expertise is expected to make a positive impact on the team's overall performance. However, replicating the dominance of the Broncos' defense from the previous year might be a challenging task, especially with a tougher schedule against stronger offenses.

The Broncos' playoff drought has extended for seven seasons, making it the second-longest active streak in the NFL. While having two home games in the opening weeks of the 2023 season could provide an advantage, breaking the streak remains a daunting challenge.

Looking ahead, the defense's performance will be crucial to the team's success in 2023. If they can maintain a high level of play despite facing tougher offenses, it will take some pressure off the offense. Additionally, a positive regression in player health could benefit the team as they work with a new coaching staff.

Russell Wilson's massive contract can potentially impact the team's ability to build a competitive roster around him. However, with Payton's coaching, there is hope that Wilson's performance will improve, and the team can maximize his potential.

The Denver Broncos' passing game in 2022 was a major disappointment, with Russell Wilson struggling to find his form. His first season with the team was plagued by poor performances, as he recorded career-lows in passing touchdowns, completion rate, and success rate. Even with an easier schedule against opposing pass defenses, the offense couldn't find a rhythm and failed to generate points consistently. The hiring of Sean Payton as the new head coach raises hopes for improvement in 2023. Payton's history of high-volume passing attacks in New Orleans suggests he can unlock Wilson's potential. However, much depends on Wilson's ability to adapt to Payton's system and elevate his performance.

The Broncos' receiving corps faced its share of challenges in 2022. Jerry Jeudy's early-season injury left the group without a key playmaker. However, rookie receiver Javonte Williams showcased his potential before suffering a knee injury. Courtland Sutton, although struggling with efficiency, showed promise, and Tim Patrick missed the entire season due to injury. The Broncos addressed the position by selecting Marvin Mims in the second round of the 2023 NFL Draft. Trade rumors surrounding Sutton might create opportunities for Mims to shine in the receiving corps. His explosive playmaking abilities could offer a new dimension to the offense.

Broncos faced setbacks in the rushing game as well, with Javonte Williams succumbing to an early-season injury. Despite his promising performances before getting injured, his status for the start of the 2023 season remains uncertain. To mitigate the risk, the team signed Samaje Perine to bolster the running back position. Perine displayed his ability to contribute as a starter for the Bengals in 2022, and he will likely be the go-to back if Williams misses time or is used in a committee when he returns. Payton's offense often involves a backfield committee, which could suit the Broncos' current situation.

Denver's defense was a major strength in 2022, but some changes have occurred during the offseason. Dre’Mont Jones' departure was compensated for by the acquisition of Zach Allen, who previously played under defensive coordinator Vance Joseph in Arizona. With D.J. Jones and Mike Purcell continuing their rotational roles, the defensive line remains solid. The linebacking corps, featuring Alex Singleton and Josey Jewell, performed well against the run, but Jewell's contract status might open the door for Drew Sanders to take on a more significant role. The secondary boasts standout cornerback Patrick Surtain, but the team will be closely monitoring the progress of rookie Riley Moss, who could compete for a starting job.

The Broncos made strategic moves in the 2023 NFL Draft to bolster key positions. Second-round pick Marvin Mims is expected to contribute as a playmaking receiver, adding depth to the receiving corps and potentially challenging KJ Hamler for playing time. Third-round selection Drew Sanders will be groomed as an inside linebacker, aiming to replace Josey Jewell in 2024. His versatility as a pass rusher and coverage player makes him a valuable addition to the defensive lineup. Riley Moss, also a third-round pick, has the opportunity to compete for a starting spot at outside cornerback, showcasing his skills in zone coverage. Sixth-round pick JL Skinner could emerge as a potential starter at safety or provide quality depth, given his ability to play both in the deep secondary and the box. Seventh-round pick Alex Forsyth might push Lloyd Cushenberry for the starting center position, showcasing the Broncos' focus on solidifying the offensive line.

Considering the Broncos' struggles in one-score games in 2022, there is cautious optimism about their prospects for the upcoming season. While many might be tempted to write them off, the coaching change and early home games offer a glimmer of hope for a more competitive campaign.

Ultimately, the Denver Broncos face a critical season in 2023 as they aim to break their playoff drought and improve upon their 2022 performance. The outcome will largely depend on the defense's ability to maintain a high level of play, Russell Wilson's resurgence under Sean Payton's guidance, and how well the team navigates a tougher schedule of opposing offenses. Fans and observers alike eagerly await to see how the team performs with Payton at the helm.
