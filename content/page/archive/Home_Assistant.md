Installing Home Assistant on a virtual machine is a popular choice for many users due to its various advantages. This method ensures greater stability and flexibility compared to running it on single-board computers like Raspberry Pi. The following paragraphs provide a step-by-step guide on how to install Home Assistant into a virtual machine.
  
Firstly, Home Assistant can be installed on a virtual machine to take advantage of the robust hardware capabilities, such as a NAS device with RAID 5 hard drives. This setup eliminates concerns about the reliability of micro SD cards or individual Raspberry Pi components. Additionally, virtual machines allow for snapshot backups, providing the ability to roll back to previous configurations.
  
To begin the installation process, users should visit the official Home Assistant website at home-assistant.io. From there, navigate to the documentation and installation section to find various installation methods for different platforms, including Windows, Mac and Linux. For virtual machine installations, users can explore alternative options, such as VirtualBox, Proxmox and VMware OVA files.
  
Select the appropriate virtual machine image that matches your hardware setup. In this example, a VDI file for VirtualBox is chosen. Download the image and unzip the contents of the downloaded file.
  
Before proceeding with the installation on a Synology NAS, ensure that the network infrastructure is properly configured. Create an untagged switch port in your switch dedicated to the IoT network and connect it to one of the NAS's Ethernet ports, separating it from the secure LAN.
  
Access the Synology NAS's virtual machine manager and begin the installation process. First, upload the VDI image to the NAS. Although this step is optional, it allows for easy reinstallation or future reference. Once the image is uploaded and healthy, proceed to create a new virtual machine.
  
During the virtual machine creation, choose the uploaded image as the operating system for Home Assistant. Ensure the system meets the minimum requirements, which are typically recommended as two CPUs and two gigabytes of RAM. Select the appropriate network, such as the IoT network, to ensure Home Assistant is on the desired network segment.
  
Configure the virtual machine with UEFI instead of legacy BIOS, grant permission to the necessary users and specify that the virtual machine should power on after creation. This finalizes the installation setup.
  
Once the installation is complete, the virtual machine manager will power on the virtual machine. An IP address in the designated IoT network should appear. Users can access the virtual machine's CLI or Home Assistant interface via a web browser using the provided IP address or the MDNS name, which might be "homeassistant.local."
  
After Home Assistant finishes its preparations, users can proceed to the initial setup wizard for Home Assistant. This marks the completion of the installation process, providing a stable and reliable Home Assistant environment in a virtual machine on a NAS or other hardware.
