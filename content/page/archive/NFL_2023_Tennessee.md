The Tennessee Titans had an eventful 2022 season and face some challenges heading into the 2023 season. Despite their ups and downs, they have shown resilience and the ability to compete even in difficult circumstances. The Titans have faced injuries and tough opponents but have managed to stay competitive and make the playoffs in recent years.

One notable achievement for the Titans was their success against the Kansas City Chiefs and quarterback Patrick Mahomes. The Titans had a winning record of 2-1 against Mahomes and came close to improving it to 3-1 in a game earlier this year. They even had a lead late in the game before the Chiefs came back to win in overtime. The Titans have shown that they can compete with top teams and perform well as underdogs.

In fact, the Titans have been particularly successful when playing as underdogs. They are the only team in the NFL with a .500 or better record when lined as an underdog since 2020, with a 12-12 record in such games. They have also covered the spread in 61% of those contests, showcasing their ability to exceed expectations.

However, despite their accomplishments, the Titans have faced criticism, particularly regarding their play calling and offensive strategy. The team has been criticized for relying too heavily on the running game and not utilizing play action and passing plays effectively. The Titans have consistently ranked low in pass rate compared to other successful teams, which has raised questions about their offensive approach.

Analyzing the Titans' play calling on first downs reveals some concerning trends. They have often faced heavy boxes and have struggled to achieve positive results on first down runs. In contrast, their first down passes have been more efficient, with higher expected points added and yards per attempt. The Titans have also struggled to convert first down runs into subsequent first downs, leading to longer and less efficient second down situations. Passing on first down has shown to be more effective in generating first downs and improving the offense's efficiency.

Furthermore, the Titans have been criticized for their balance between the run and pass game when using heavier personnel sets. Despite facing stacked boxes, they have continued to run the ball at a high rate, which has resulted in below-average efficiency. Passing from heavier sets has shown to be more productive, but the Titans have not adjusted their play calling accordingly.

These issues with play calling and offensive strategy have been evident to fans, analysts, and even casual observers. The lack of adjustment and utilization of more effective strategies is a cause for concern and has led to questions about the team's awareness and decision-making.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, the Titans' roster rankings suggest they have the fifth-worst roster in the league. This ranking, combined with potential quarterback uncertainties and the declining skill set of Ryan Tannehill, paints a challenging picture for the team. The Titans' backfield, led by Derrick Henry, remains a strong unit, but questions about Henry's declining explosiveness raise concerns. The receiving corps lacks depth and proven talent beyond Treylon Burks and Chigoziem Okonkwo.

On the offensive line, the Titans had struggles at the left tackle position in 2022, allowing pressure at a league-worst rate. The team will need to address this issue and find a more reliable option to protect their quarterbacks.

In the 2022 season, the Tennessee Titans heavily relied on their veteran pass catchers, Robert Woods and Austin Hooper, who led the team in receptions with 53 and 41 respectively. However, both Woods and Hooper have departed for the upcoming season, creating an opportunity for the team's young pass catchers to step up. The Titans will now look to Treylon Burks, Chigoziem Okonkwo and Kyle Philips to make significant contributions. Burks showcased his potential as a rookie, despite missing six games, by catching 33 of his 54 targets for 444 yards and a touchdown. On the other hand, Okonkwo, despite only playing 37% of offensive snaps, impressed as a rookie tight end. Among all tight ends in the NFL who ran 100 or more pass routes last season, Okonkwo ranked first in yards per route run (2.63) and second in targets per route run (26.9%). The addition of DeAndre Hopkins to the mix will undoubtedly bring a new dynamic to the team's receiving corps and it will be intriguing to see how the chemistry develops with the revamped group of pass catchers in the 2023 season.

Defensively, the Titans have shown strength against the run, but their pass defense has struggled, ranking 27th in expected points added per dropback. The return of Harold Landry from injury should bolster their pass rush, but concerns remain in the secondary, particularly with players like Caleb Farley dealing with injury issues and inconsistency.

Head coach Mike Vrabel's rankings among NFL head coaches vary, with some placing him in the top 10 and others in the bottom half of the league. Critics argue that Vrabel needs to be more aggressive in certain situations and avoid a defeatist approach to the game, such as running the ball on second and long.

In summary, the Tennessee Titans had a mixed 2022 season, demonstrating resilience but also facing challenges. Concerns have been raised regarding their play calling and offensive strategy, particularly their reliance on the running game and underutilization of effective passing plays. The team faces roster deficiencies and uncertainties, which may impact their performance in the 2023 season. However, the Titans have shown the ability to compete and overcome adversity, making them a team to watch as they navigate the upcoming season. I predict seven wins for the Titans.
