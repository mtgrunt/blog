The Chicago Bears entered the 2022 season with high expectations after acquiring Justin Fields in the draft and bringing in a new coaching staff. However, the team struggled, finishing with a 6-11 record and dealing with significant dead cap issues. The Bears had the highest dead cap in NFL history, totaling $93 million, limiting their ability to invest in the roster. As a result, they had the lowest cash spent on their roster in the league.

Despite the low expectations, the Bears failed to meet even those modest projections. They won only three games and had the second-worst against-the-spread (ATS) mark in the NFL. Their performance in the second half of the season was particularly disappointing, with the team failing to cover the spread in seven out of eight games.

Now, heading into the 2023 season, the Bears are in Year 3 with Justin Fields. This is the crucial year to see progress and evaluate Fields' potential as a franchise quarterback. With several changes in the NFC, including Aaron Rodgers no longer being in the NFC North, this is an opportunity for the Bears to make a statement.

However, there are concerns about the team's approach for the upcoming season. As of now, the Bears rank 26th in spending on their 2023 roster. While their dead cap situation has improved, they have ample cap space available but have not made significant investments in the roster. This raises questions about their commitment to providing Fields with the necessary support.

One area that needs immediate attention is the offensive line. The Bears' offensive line struggled in pass protection, allowing the highest sack percentage in the NFL in the past two seasons. To unlock Fields' potential, the team needs to provide him with better pass protection. While some additions have been made, such as Nate Davis and rookie Darnell Wright, it remains to be seen if these changes will be sufficient.

In 2022, the Bears had a brief offensive surge after Week 6, but it was not sustainable. Their success on third downs, especially in avoiding sacks and performing well in the red zone, played a significant role. However, this level of performance is difficult to maintain, as demonstrated by their regression in the latter part of the season.

Looking ahead to 2023, the Bears have a favorable schedule and an advantageous rest edge. They project to face relatively easy pass and run defenses, providing an opportunity for offensive improvement. Justin Fields' development and the addition of D.J. Moore should also bolster the team.

The Bears made several moves in the 2023 NFL Draft to address areas of need. Their first-round selection, Darnell Wright, is expected to start immediately at right tackle. However, there are concerns about his readiness for the pro game due to limited pass protection snaps in college. Gervon Dexter and Zacch Pickens, selected in the second and third rounds respectively, are athletic interior linemen with potential as pass rushers. While they had inconsistent performances in college, they have the opportunity to develop at the professional level. In the second round, the Bears added Tyrique Stevenson, an outside corner with ideal length who also has experience playing in the slot. Stevenson showed improvement in on-ball production throughout his college career, peaking in 2022. Roschon Johnson, drafted in the fourth round, will compete for carries in the backfield. He is a powerful runner who excels at forcing missed tackles. The Bears also added Tyler Scott, who brings dynamic playmaking ability after the catch, and Noah Sewell, providing depth at linebacker. Terrell Smith, a traits-based project with elite length, was selected in the fifth round. He will have time to develop without immediate pressure to contribute. Kendall Williamson, drafted in the seventh round, also brings length and outproduced Smith in terms of on-ball production in college. Finally, the Bears added Travis Bell as an interior lineman in the seventh round. While Bell's selection was surprising, he provides additional depth to the position group.

The Bears' offensive philosophy in the previous season remains unclear, and it is uncertain how much of their low pass rate was due to coaching philosophy or limitations. They finished with a low neutral pass rate and had a pass rate over expected of -14.1%, the lowest in recent years. The addition of D.J. Moore suggests a potential increase in passing frequency. However, for the offense to improve, Justin Fields needs to improve his accuracy and avoid negative plays. He had high sack and interception rates in the previous season.

The arrival of D.J. Moore provides Justin Fields with his best receiving option since his time at Ohio State. Moore has been productive throughout his career, despite playing with lackluster quarterbacks. His addition pushes Darnell Mooney down the depth chart after an underwhelming season. The Bears attempted to upgrade their receiving group by trading for Chase Claypool, but his production was limited. Overall, the Bears' receiving corps has the potential to improve with Moore's presence.

The departure of David Montgomery in free agency led to a scattered approach in replacing him. Khalil Herbert, who had a productive rookie season, leads the incumbent backs. The Bears also added D'Onta Foreman, who has been a reliable stopgap option in previous seasons and drafted Roschon Johnson, who has the potential to carve out a role early. Personally, I think Johnson is undervalued. It remains to be seen how the backfield will shape up, but all three backs have shown promise as yard creators. 

The Bears made improvements to their defensive line with the addition of Andrew Billings and the drafting of Gervon Dexter and Zacch Pickens. These moves aim to upgrade the interior and provide a stronger pass rush. Trevis Gipson and DeMarcus Walker add depth to the edge rushing position, and the signing of Rasheem Green brings additional pass-rushing ability. The addition of Tremaine Edmunds and T.J. Edwards at linebacker significantly improves the defense's chances of turning things around. However, there is a need for improvement in pass defense, as the Bears allowed a high yards-per-reception average and struggled in coverage last season.

In conclusion, the Chicago Bears have potential for improvement in the 2023 season, but there are also several unanswered questions. The team's conservative spending approach, combined with offensive concerns, limit their upside. It remains to be seen how Justin Fields will progress in Year 3 and whether the Bears can provide him with the necessary support to succeed.
