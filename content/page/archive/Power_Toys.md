PowerToys is a versatile collection of utilities and applications designed to enhance the functionality of Windows and boost your productivity. These tools offer a wide range of features, shortcuts, enhancements, and various ways to make your Windows experience more efficient. PowerToys even introduces some features that you might have encountered in other operating systems but can now enable in Windows. Whether you're new to PowerToys or haven't explored all its features recently, let's delve into each utility in the PowerToys suite, and by the end, you'll be a proficient userâ€”or at least, you'll look like one with these powerful tools at your disposal.

Once installed, PowerToys places a handy icon in your system tray, allowing you to launch individual applications, toggle features on and off, or access all the application settings easily.

The "Always On Top" feature allows you to pin windows on top of all others, ensuring they remain visible regardless of which window is in focus. You can activate this by pressing Windows Key + Control + T, and it will display a border around the selected window. You can customize the border's color, thickness, corners, and sound effects. Additionally, you can exclude specific apps from being pinned on top.

"Awake" is a utility that keeps your computer awake without altering your power and sleep settings. This is beneficial for presentations, conferences, or any tasks where you don't want your computer to go to sleep or turn off the screen. You can configure it to maintain the current power plan, keep the computer awake indefinitely, or set a time interval for the utility to stay active.

The "Color Picker" is a fantastic tool for selecting colors from any running application and copying them into a customizable format on your clipboard. It works system-wide and is invaluable for designers and developers. To activate it, press Windows Key + Shift + C, drag your cursor to a color, and it will display the color preview and value. You can customize the tool's behavior in the settings, including choosing whether to open an editor or just pick a color, and even customize color formats.

"Fancy Zones" is a powerful Windows manager utility that lets you arrange and snap windows into custom layouts quickly. You can choose from existing templates or create your own, making it easier to manage multiple windows on your screen. This utility offers various customization options, including adjusting template settings, colors, multi-monitor support, and more.

"File Locksmith" helps you identify which processes are using specific files. It's particularly useful for troubleshooting and figuring out which application is locking a file. You can check which files are being accessed and even end processes from within the utility.

This utility enhances Windows Explorer by enabling additional file types for preview in the right-hand pane. You can preview SVG, markdown, source code files, PDFs, and G code files, making it easier to work with a wider range of file formats.

The "Host File Editor" simplifies editing your host file, which Windows uses to resolve IP addresses. It allows you to add, edit, and manage host entries without making manual changes. This can be useful for managing network configurations and web development.

The "Image Resizer" simplifies the process of resizing images in bulk. You can right-click on multiple image files and choose to resize them with various preset options. This is a time-saving feature for anyone who frequently works with images.

"Keyboard Manager" enables you to remap keys on your keyboard. You can customize key mappings and even remap shortcuts. It's a useful tool for optimizing your keyboard layout to suit your preferences.

"Mouse Utilities" offers several features to enhance mouse and cursor functions in Windows. These include "Find My Mouse," "Mouse Highlighter," "Mouse Gem," and "Mouse Pointer Crosshairs," which help you locate the cursor, highlight clicks, navigate large displays, and provide crosshair pointers, respectively.
"Mouse Without Borders" allows you to control up to four computers from one machine with a single keyboard and mouse. It's particularly helpful for multitasking across multiple devices and sharing files and text between them.

"Paste As Plain Text" simplifies copying and pasting by stripping formatting from text. You can paste text without any unwanted styles or formatting, making it easier to work with content from various sources.

"Peek" lets you preview files without opening them, offering a quick way to check the content of a file before fully opening it.

"Power Rename" is a bulk renaming tool that allows you to rename multiple files at once. It offers various options, including search and replace, enumeration, and custom text insertion, making it a powerful tool for managing files in bulk.

"PowerToys Run" is a quick launcher utility that lets you launch applications, search for files, settings, and even perform calculations just by typing. It's faster and more efficient than the traditional Windows Start menu.

"Quick Accent" provides a convenient way to type accented characters on keyboards that lack dedicated accent keys. It simplifies the process of adding accents to characters in different languages.

"Registry Preview" offers a visual way to preview registry changes, making it easier to understand and validate modifications before applying them.

"Screen Ruler" is a useful tool for designers and developers, allowing you to measure pixel distances on your screen with ease.

The "Shortcut Guide" provides an overlay displaying common Windows shortcuts, making it easy to access and remember essential keyboard shortcuts.

"Text Extractor" uses OCR technology to extract text from images or screenshots and copy it to your clipboard. It's a handy tool for digitizing text from pictures.

"Video Conference Mute" provides shortcuts to mute and unmute your camera and microphone during video conferences. While this feature is in legacy mode, it can still be useful for managing video conferencing settings.

I used PowerToys a year ago and it helped me a bunch. PowerToys continues to evolve and add new features, making it a valuable set of utilities for Windows users. Whether you're a casual user or a power user, PowerToys offers something to streamline your Windows experience and boost your productivity.
