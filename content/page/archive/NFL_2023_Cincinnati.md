The Cincinnati Bengals' journey from the 2020 season to the present has been a remarkable one. In 2020, they struggled with a 2-7-1 record and the loss of Joe Burrow for the year. They won only four games throughout the season and faced issues across the roster and coaching staff. However, in the two years since then, they have made back-to-back appearances in the AFC Championship games.

The Bengals have clearly made significant progress, but their ultimate goal is to win the Super Bowl. It's worth noting how recent 2020 feels in hindsight, given the powerhouse playoff runs the Bengals have had in the past two seasons.

The 2021 season was particularly promising for the Bengals, as they came close to winning it all. They showed significant improvement from 2020, but there was one issue that stood out: their tendency to run the ball on first down. Despite having a top-3 passing offense, they ran the ball at a high rate on first downs, despite it being less efficient compared to passing. This was a puzzling decision, as Joe Burrow excelled in first down passing situations.

Fortunately, the Bengals made adjustments in the 2022 season. While it took some time for them to fully embrace a pass-heavy approach, they eventually became the second-most pass-heavy team on first downs in the NFL. This change proved beneficial for their offense, as Burrow's performance improved significantly when facing 2-high coverages, which had troubled the team in 2021. By Week 5 of the 2022 season, the Bengals consistently maintained a pass rate above 60% on first downs.

Furthermore, the Bengals implemented a shotgun-heavy approach on early downs, minimizing the use of play action. This adjustment allowed Burrow more freedom to make quick decisions and throw the ball without physical restrictions. Despite the faster pace of their pass attempts, Burrow's average time to throw remained consistent, and his target depth even increased. Overall, these changes contributed to the Bengals' offensive success.

In terms of personnel, the Bengals increased their usage of 11 personnel and reduced their reliance on 12 personnel. They also became the most pass-heavy team in the NFL, which played to their strengths with Burrow and their talented wide receivers. This offensive strategy proved effective, reducing pressure on Burrow and improving the team's overall efficiency.

However, while the passing offense thrived, the Bengals' running game faced challenges. Despite an improved offensive line and facing lighter boxes, Joe Mixon's efficiency declined in 2022 compared to the previous year. This raises questions about the allocation of cap space to Mixon, considering his declining performance and the team's shift towards a more pass-oriented offense.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, the Bengals' passing attack appears to be their strongest asset. Burrow's style of play has become more focused on high efficiency, quick releases, and minimizing sacks. The offense relies on a straightforward approach, with low usage of play action and pre-snap motion. With a talented quarterback and wide receivers, this plan should continue to yield positive results, provided the team remains healthy.

The Bengals' main challenge in the AFC remains the Kansas City Chiefs. However, their defensive coordinator, Lou Anarumo, has shown an ability to slow down Patrick Mahomes by forcing him to hold onto the ball longer. Anarumo has used various defensive schemes to disrupt Mahomes' timing, resulting in success against the Chiefs in their previous meetings. The Bengals will need to continue finding ways to contain Mahomes while ensuring Burrow has sufficient protection.

In last year's AFC Championship game, the pressure on Burrow played a significant role in the Bengals' loss. The Chiefs effectively pressured Burrow without relying heavily on blitzing, causing the Bengals' offense to struggle. The Bengals must address their offensive line to mitigate pressure on Burrow and maximize their chances of success against top-tier opponents.

Joe Burrow has been exceptional for the Bengals, ranking among the top quarterbacks in various statistical categories. He has led the team to back-to-back appearances in the AFC Championship games. Going into the 2023 season, the Bengals will look to extend Burrow's contract and solidify their quarterback position. However, they lack strong backup options if Burrow were to miss any time.

The Bengals boast one of the best wide receiver groups in the league with Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins, and Tyler Boyd. However, injuries have hindered their collective impact. When all three are on the field, the Bengals' offense is significantly more potent. Going into the 2023 season, the team will need to prioritize keeping their talented receivers healthy. Additionally, both Boyd and Higgins are entering the final year of their contracts, adding a sense of urgency to their performances.

Joe Mixon's future with the Bengals has been the subject of speculation. While there were rumors of a potential release or contract restructuring, Mixon's status remains unchanged. However, his performance in the 2022 season was subpar, with below-average yards per carry and yards after contact. The Bengals will need to evaluate whether Mixon's production justifies his contract. Behind Mixon, the team has relatively inexperienced running backs, so adding depth in the backfield might be a consideration.

The Bengals have notable defensive players, such as D.J. Reader, B.J. Hill, Trey Hendrickson, and Sam Hubbard. These players have made significant contributions, particularly in run defense and pass rushing. The team has also added Myles Murphy in the draft to bolster their pass rush. However, there are concerns in the secondary, with injuries impacting Chidobe Awuize's playing time and the departure of key safeties like Jessie Bates and Vonn Bell. The Bengals will rely on younger players like Dax Hill and Nick Scott to step up in the safety positions.

The Bengals' draft strategy focused on addressing their pass rush with the selection of Myles Murphy in the first round. Murphy has the potential to develop into a starter and provides depth behind Trey Hendrickson and Sam Hubbard. DJ Turner, Jordan Battle, and Charlie Jones were also drafted to strengthen depth and compete for future starting roles. The class shows a preference for players with leadership qualities and big-game experience. While immediate impact may be limited, these players have the potential to contribute in the future.

In summary, the Bengals have made significant strides since their 2020 season. They have built a strong passing offense and shown the ability to adjust their game plan midseason. With continued health and further adjustments, they have a strong chance of reaching the AFC Championship game and potentially upsetting the Chiefs. However, they must address their running game and find ways to protect Burrow from pressure to fully realize their potential in the upcoming 2023 season.
