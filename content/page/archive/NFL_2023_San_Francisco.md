In the 2022 season, the San Francisco 49ers faced a familiar challenge with injuries. It seemed like an ongoing issue since Kyle Shanahan became the head coach in 2017, as the team consistently ranked among the most injured in the league. This pattern continued in 2022, with the 49ers being the 9th most injured team. However, despite these setbacks, they showed promise and resilience throughout the season.

In 2021, the 49ers faced numerous injuries to key players, including QB1, RB1, TE1, WR1, and WR2, yet they still managed to make it to the NFC Championship game. Similarly, in 2022, the team went on a remarkable 12-game winning streak after Week 7 before QB1 and QB2 were injured in the NFC Championship game. This highlighted the potential of the team when healthy and underscored the importance of keeping key players on the field in 2023.

Heading into the 2023 season, the 49ers face the challenge of limited depth at certain positions. They have invested significantly in their running back position, but beyond their star wide receivers, Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk, the team lacks depth in the receiving corps. The tight end position also faces a shortage of options beyond George Kittle, despite the addition of Cameron Latu from Alabama in the draft.

The secondary is another area of concern due to a lack of depth and notable turnover. As they compete in a tough division, the 49ers must address these weaknesses to maintain their success on defense.

The team's fortunes have often been tied to the availability of their starting quarterback, Jimmy Garoppolo. With Garoppolo on the field, the 49ers have been remarkably efficient, ranking second in EPA per snap in the NFL. However, when Garoppolo is absent due to injury, the team's performance drops significantly, ranking 31st in EPA per snap. This highlights the importance of having a reliable backup quarterback and finding ways to protect their starters. Personally, my interest was getting Garoppolo off the team many years ago, but I digress. Good luck Jimmy!

In 2022, the 49ers saw improvement in their offense after trading for Christian McCaffrey. He performance on early downs with McCaffrey improved significantly, showcasing the impact of a strong running back presence. Rookie, Brock Purdy stepped in and demonstrated promising potential. Shanahan managed Purdy effectively, keeping the offense efficient and preventing obvious passing situations.

Shanahan's offensive scheme has been highly effective in getting receivers open, leading to high expected completion rates and generating yards after the catch, Yards After Catch, (YAC). The reduced use of play action in 2022 raised some questions, but Shanahan's ability to adjust and improve his offense throughout the season showcased his coaching prowess.

2022 San Francisco 49ers personnel usage: 11 personnel was used 42% of the time, 12 personell was used 16% of the time, 21 personell was used 33% of the time and 22 personell was used 7% of the time. 

The San Francisco 49ers had an impressive passing attack in the 2022 season, ranking fourth in EPA per dropback, thanks to the wizardry of their head coach, Kyle Shanahan. Despite facing injuries and starting three different quarterbacks, including Brock Purdy, the 49ers' offense remained highly effective. Purdy showed promise, finishing third in EPA per play among qualifying quarterbacks after Week 13, and he could be a contender for the starting job in 2023. However, the team also has Trey Lance and Sam Darnold in the mix, making the quarterback room unproven but potentially potent under Shanahan's guidance.

The receiving corps faced challenges with injuries in 2022, but Brandon Aiyuk stepped up in Deebo Samuel's absence, leading the team in targets and making a significant impact. George Kittle, while not as heavily utilized in the passing game as other elite tight ends, remains efficient and a major red zone threat, scoring 11 touchdowns in the previous season. The acquisition of Christian McCaffrey in the middle of the 2022 season further strengthened their passing arsenal, providing the team with a versatile and dynamic running back option.

The 49ers' rushing game was significantly boosted by the addition of Christian McCaffrey in Week 7 of the 2022 season. McCaffrey displayed his talent by averaging 5.7 yards per touch and scoring 11 touchdowns after joining the team. Alongside McCaffrey, Elijah Mitchell adds depth to the backfield, and if both players stay healthy, the 49ers' running game has the potential to be one of the most productive in the league. However, the offensive line also faces some questions that need to be addressed.

On the defensive side, the 49ers had a dominant run defense and excelled against short passing plays. However, they struggled against deep passes, ranking 31st in EPA per attempt and success rate against passes thrown 15+ yards downfield. With notable turnover in the secondary, there are concerns about their ability to defend against stronger passing offenses in the 2023 season.

49ers made significant improvements to their interior defensive line with the addition of Javon Hargrave. His presence will enhance the team's formidable defensive line that already ranked highly in quarterback knockdowns and pressure rate in 2022, coupled with Arik Armstead. Nick Bosa continues to be a dominant force on the edge, leading the league in sacks and earning the Defensive Player of the Year honors. However, the team lacks depth at the edge position, and young players like Drake Jackson will have to step up to fill the void left by departed players.

Fred Warner and Dre Greenlaw have been crucial to the linebacker unit, recording a combined total of 161 solo tackles in the previous season. Charvarius Ward is number one in S.F. While the other cornerbacks remain a concern for the 49ers, players like Deommodore Lenoir and Tashaun Gipson have shown promise in their roles, but more depth may be needed.

Looking at their draft class for 2023, the 49ers managed to find potential starters like Ji'Ayir Brown in the third round, who could provide depth at the safety position. However, the decision to draft a kicker, Jake Moody, in the third round raised eyebrows, as NFL teams historically struggle to identify the best kickers from a draft class. Alas, I'm keen on it. Gould was not an option. Other picks like Cameron Latu offer insurance behind George Kittle at tight end, while players like Darrell Luter Jr. and Ronnie Bell add depth and potential to the team's roster.

In addition to the on-field challenges, the 49ers face a significant rest disadvantage in 2023, playing five games with fewer rest days than their opponents. This scheduling issue could add extra difficulty to an already competitive season.

Overall, the 49ers have a talented roster, and if they can stay healthy and address their depth concerns, they have the potential to be a formidable force in the upcoming season. Kyle Shanahan's coaching ability and adaptability will play a crucial role in determining the team's success, as they look to make a strong playoff run in 2023.
