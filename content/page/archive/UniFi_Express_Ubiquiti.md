UniFi Express from Ubiquiti is a game-changer for small and home networks, offering remarkable flexibility in a compact form factor. Its ability to function as a gateway with Wi-Fi 6 capabilities makes it a versatile solution for powering entire networks. The device can also be transformed into a mesh system, expanding wireless coverage effortlessly. Alternatively, it seamlessly integrates into existing networks in Access Point Only mode.

This device is an excellent entry point for those new to UniFi's network app and wireless access points. If you're already part of the UniFi ecosystem, the UniFi Express can easily integrate into your existing network. The small, all-white device measures just 3.5 inches in length and width, with a height of approximately one inch. Despite its plastic construction, an aluminum bottom aids in heat dissipation. Powered by USB-C, it features a gigabit LAN port and a gigabit WAN port, along with 2x2 MIMO support for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequencies, accommodating Wi-Fi 6 standards.

Setting up the UniFi Express is a straightforward process. After adoption, users can manage the device via the UniFi network app on their mobile devices or through the web. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of network health and statistics. The application allows users to delve into different aspects of their network, such as topology, UniFi devices, client devices, ports, radios and more.

The UniFi Express supports up to 8 unique SSIDs and can handle over 60 clients simultaneously, making it suitable for various scenarios. Its LCM screen displays network status, enhancing user visibility. The device's extensive feature set includes Wi-Fi optimization, VLAN configuration, VPN setup (including the innovative Teleport) and advanced security options. Notably, it lacks IDS and IPS, potentially for cost and performance reasons, but compensates with general security configurations.

The UniFi Express caters to a wide range of users and scenarios. It's ideal for small businesses seeking a cost-effective yet powerful network solution with Wi-Fi 6 capabilities. For existing UniFi networks, it serves as an easy-to-add access point or mesh extender. Remote workers can connect securely to corporate networks through its VPN capabilities. At home, it offers a simple way to create a mesh network, and its compact size makes it suitable for travel routers. Its versatility makes it applicable to various use cases, from first-time users to prosumers and even specialized applications like remote tech support.
