Wazuh is a remarkable cybersecurity tool that you definitely need to deploy. It is not only free and open source, which is impressive in itself, but it offers a fantastic opportunity to learn about hacking and security while protecting your assets. The deployment process is quick and easy, allowing you to set up the server and agents on various platforms like Windows, macOS and Linux.

The agents act like tattletales, providing comprehensive information on security configurations, vulnerabilities, and even tracking changes to files and the Windows registry. All this data is sent to your central server, giving you a consolidated view of your entire network. You receive alerts through email, enabling you to take immediate action with active responses, such as blocking malicious IP addresses during brute force attacks.

Wazuh belongs to a category of cybersecurity tools called Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or ASIM (Active Response Information Management). This type of tool is commonly used by the blue team, the defensive side of cybersecurity, to defend against cyber threats and hackers. To deploy Wazuh, you only need two things: a Linux server or computer and the devices you want to monitor. It supports most flavors of Linux. The system requirements for the Wazuh server are relatively modest and can be upgraded based on your needs.

Whether you choose to deploy Wazuh on a cloud machine, on-premises or in a Docker container, the process is straightforward and well-documented. With Wazuh, you not only protect your systems but also gain valuable knowledge in the world of cybersecurity, which can be a valuable addition to your resume. The demonstration also covered the process of adding agents to the Wazuh server, allowing you to monitor various devices, including Windows and Linux hosts. The agents provide detailed information on potential security threats and vulnerabilities, giving you insights into potential attacks and/or exploits. 

One of its core features is Secure Configuration Assessment (SCA), which provides a detailed analysis of your system's security configuration. It performs a CIS assessment and identifies potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. For instance, it checks if critical security settings like disabling USB storage or enabling firewalls are properly configured. The SCA module also educates users by providing explanations for each finding, making it a valuable learning tool.

Another essential aspect of Wazuh is its ability to monitor files and registry changes in real-time. For example, you can set up the File Integrity Monitoring module to detect any modifications made to critical files and directories. Additionally, it can track changes to the Windows registry, making it useful for detecting potential intrusions or unauthorized access. With these capabilities, you can gain valuable insights into system activity and respond proactively to security incidents.

The Active Response feature in Wazuh is incredibly powerful and allows you to take immediate actions based on specific security events. For example, you can set up an active response rule to block IP addresses attempting brute force attacks. This feature can save time and reduce the risk of successful attacks by automatically mitigating threats.
Vulnerability scanning is another essential feature of Wazuh. By enabling vulnerability detection, Wazuh can perform regular scans to identify known vulnerabilities in your system and applications. This enables you to proactively address security issues and apply patches or updates to protect your system from potential exploits.

In conclusion, Wazuh is a powerful and comprehensive cybersecurity tool that provides a wide range of functionalities to protect your systems and enhance your security posture. Features for secure configuration assessment, real-time monitoring, active response, vulnerability scanning and integrations make it an invaluable asset for cybersecurity enthusiasts, professionals and organizations.
