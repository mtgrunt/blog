## "Red Hat Lockdown"

Red Hat's official response emphasizes the importance of contributing back to open-source projects and criticizes those who only use open-source code without adding value or making any changes. They describe these users as a real threat to open-source companies worldwide. Red Hat has taken steps to address this issue by introducing CentOS Stream as a platform for collaboration around Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). This move has proven successful in terms of shortening the feedback window between Red Hat engineers, partners, customers, and communities while providing increased visibility into the next innovations in RHEL.

The company highlights the positive outcomes achieved through the Special Interest Group (SIG) community, which has facilitated the integration of new technologies at a faster pace. They specifically mention the Automotive SIG as an example of this success. Additionally, hardware partners have embraced CentOS Stream for quicker support of new hardware technologies. This shift has made the development of Red Hat Enterprise Linux more transparent and open than ever before.

To further emphasize their commitment to CentOS Stream as the backbone of enterprise Linux innovation, Red Hat has made the decision to make it the sole repository for public RHEL-related source code releases. This change does not affect the CentOS Project, CentOS Stream, or the availability of source code for CentOS Stream or CentOS SIGs. Red Hat customers and partners can still access RHEL sources through the Red Hat Customer Portal, ensuring that source code remains available to them.

The reason behind this change lies in the inefficiency of maintaining separate repositories for CentOS Linux and CentOS Stream. Previously, Red Hat pushed public sources for RHEL to git.centos.org, even though CentOS Linux was no longer being built downstream of RHEL. However, given the increased engagement and engineering investments associated with CentOS Stream, maintaining redundant repositories is no longer practical. By streamlining the repositories, the latest source code will continue to be available via CentOS Stream, while Red Hat customers and partners can access RHEL sources through the appropriate portals based on their subscription agreements.

My take on it is disappointing towards Red Hat's decision to lock down access to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) sources behind a Red Hat subscription. They start by questioning the intelligence of this move and convey their anger when Red Hat transformed the community CentOS distribution into a leading-edge distro rather than a free version of RHEL.

Having been disappointed once before by Red Hat's decisions, my thoughts are contemplating whether they should continue supporting Fedora or completely drop support for RHEL and RHEL-like distributions in their open-source projects. They express doubts about alternative projects like Rocky or Alma Linux being able to fill the gap left by the demise of CentOS, particularly for users like themselves.

I reject the suggestion of using a Red Hat Developer Subscription as a solution, pointing out that other Linux distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, or Arch don't require such subscriptions. They imply that the hassle and limitations associated with RHEL are not worth it when there are other viable options available.
