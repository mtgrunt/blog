The Atlanta Falcons, led by Head Coach Arthur Smith in his second year, have shown a pattern of average performance over the past three seasons. With records of 7-10 in both 2021 and 2022, and 4-12 in 2020, the team has been striving for improvement.

In 2023, the Falcons' offensive coordinator position remains with Arthur Smith, who also calls the plays. The team has made a notable change by hiring Ryan Nielsen as the defensive coordinator. Nielsen previously served as the New Orleans Saints' Defensive Line Coach, bringing his expertise to enhance the Falcons' defensive strategies.

The Falcons' depth chart for the 2023 season includes quarterback Desmond Ridder, running back Bijan Robinson, and wide receivers Drake London, Mack Hollins and Scotty Miller. They have a promising rookie tight end in Kyle Pitts, who is expected to make an impact. The offensive line is anchored by left tackle Jake Matthews and right tackle Kaleb McGary.

Defensively, the Falcons operate a base 3-4 scheme. Their front seven features notable players such as defensive ends Calais Campbell and Grady Jarrett, linebacker Bud Dupree, and cornerback A.J. Terrell. The secondary includes safety Richie Grant and cornerback Jeff Okudah.

Looking back at the 2022 season, the Falcons faced significant challenges due to a high amount of dead cap, including the contracts of Matt Ryan and Julio Jones. Despite these financial constraints, the team managed to compete, although accuracy issues plagued their quarterbacks, ranking near the bottom in accuracy among all qualifying QBs.

Defensively, the Falcons struggled in their pass defense, ranking low in EPA/att, success rate and third-down conversion rate allowed. Improving the passing game and rushing defense are key areas that need attention.

In terms of the team's outlook for the 2023 season, there is optimism for improvement. With a projected nine wins and the second-easiest strength of schedule, the Falcons have an opportunity to capitalize on their divisional games and matchups against the AFC South. Their investments in free agency and the addition of rookie talent indicate a desire to strengthen the roster.

The Falcons' offensive strategy heavily relies on play action, which was effective in 2022. However, the team's success in the running game will depend on their ability to overcome loaded boxes and create productive runs. The addition of Bijan Robinson to the backfield is expected to contribute positively to the offense.

Defensively, the Falcons aim to stabilize their unit with the acquisitions of Bud Dupree, Calais Campbell and David Onyemata. However, the absence of a premier edge rusher limits their ceiling.

The Falcons showed a positive trend in second-half performance during the 2022 season, which contributed to close games. They covered the spread in a 6-point teaser leg in 15 of 17 games, showcasing their ability to compete and potentially surprise opponents.

Arthur Smith's track record as a red zone offensive coordinator with the Tennessee Titans provides hope for improved efficiency in the red zone. However, Desmond Ridder's development and ability to perform in clean pockets will be crucial for the team's success. The Falcons' offensive strategy of ball control and limited penalties aims to keep them competitive and potentially contend for a playoff spot.

The Atlanta Falcons enter the 2023 season with a mix of challenges and opportunities. With coaching adjustments, improvements in key areas and the development of young talent, they strive to build a competitive team and surpass their recent records. I have nine wins overall.
