In 2022, the Buffalo Bills focused on improving their running game and reducing Josh Allen's reliance on rushing. Head coach Sean McDermott made it clear that he wanted the team to run the ball more effectively. The addition of offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey brought positive changes to the offense, and there was anticipation about how he would manage the unit.

During the early downs in the first three quarters of games, the Bills had a high pass rate, ranking third in the NFL with a 64.7% pass rate. Although they were more pass-heavy in 2022 compared to 2021, they did see a slight decrease in pass rate after Allen's injury. However, under Dorsey's guidance, the Bills did not become significantly more run-heavy.

Despite not becoming more run-heavy, the Bills improved their performance when running the ball. McDermott made it a focus to address the running game, and the front office made personnel changes to strengthen the offensive line. The addition of players like James Cook from Georgia and guards Rodger Saffold and David Quessenberry improved the running game's efficiency.

The Bills saw a significant improvement in their performance on first down runs. In 2022, they ranked first in yards per carry (YPC), second in success rate, and fifth in expected points added per attempt (EPA/att) on first down runs. This improvement was not only due to personnel changes but also factors like facing lighter defensive boxes and improved yards before contact per rush attempt.

Devin Singletary, the Bills' running back, saw an increase in yards before contact per rush attempt in 2022 compared to previous years. James Cook, who replaced Zack Moss, had an exceptional performance with 4.14 yards before contact per rush attempt, ranking first among all running backs. The Bills' improved running game allowed them to slightly reduce their average distance-to-go on third downs.

On third downs, the Bills had a shorter distance to go in 2022 compared to 2021, and they converted a league-leading 55% of their third downs into first downs. This improvement in third-down conversion rate was a positive outcome for the team, as it contributed to their overall offensive success.

Looking ahead to 2023, the Bills face a critical season. Despite their impressive regular-season performances in recent years, they have yet to secure a Super Bowl appearance. This season is vital for the franchise, as they aim to become the AFC's number one seed.

The Bills' offensive outlook for 2023 looks promising with Josh Allen under contract through 2028. The team made moves to strengthen their offensive line and receiving corps. They also drafted tight end Dalton Kincaid, adding more diversity to their passing game beyond Stefon Diggs.

On the defensive side, the Bills have players like Ed Oliver and Von Miller, who showed strong performances in 2022. Matt Milano proved to be one of the league's best linebackers, while Tre'Davious White returned to full health after missing games. The Bills will rely on their defensive players to continue their strong performance and make an impact in the upcoming season.

In summary, the Buffalo Bills made significant improvements to their running game in 2022 while maintaining a pass-heavy offense. Their personnel changes, better efficiency on first down runs, and improved performance on third downs contributed to their offensive success. As they enter the 2023 season, the Bills aim to secure the AFC's number one seed and make a deeper playoff run.
