The Philadelphia Eagles had a successful 2022 season, particularly in the first half of games. They emphasized the importance of scoring inside the red zone, as the majority of offensive touchdowns across the league were scored from within the 20-yard line. However, in the previous year, the Eagles struggled to convert inside the 10-yard line, ranking 24th in the NFL with a 69% touchdown rate. It was noted that quarterback Jalen Hurts and head coach Nick Sirianni needed to improve their performance in tight spaces.

Fortunately, the Eagles addressed this issue in 2022. They became the NFL's fifth-highest scoring team in goal-to-go situations, converting touchdowns at an impressive 83% rate. This improvement significantly impacted the team's overall success. Additionally, Jalen Hurts showed significant growth in his second year, as predicted. Quarterbacks tend to make strides in their sophomore seasons, and Hurts was no exception.

In terms of scoring, the Eagles were dominant in the first half of games, recording 296 points. This placed them seventh in NFL history for most first-half points scored. Their halftime leads were unparalleled, with a margin of 121 points, far surpassing the second-best team, the San Francisco 49ers, by 18 points. However, the Eagles notably dropped off in the second half, ranking 19th in expected points added (EPA) per play and 22nd in early down success rate (EDSR).

Interestingly, the Eagles began games as a pass-first team, boasting the fifth-highest pass rate in the first half. However, they also possessed the most efficient rushing offense in the league. Despite their success on the ground, they recognized the greater efficiency of passing and maintained the NFL's fifth-highest early down pass rate. The team's rushing attack was exceptional, ranking first in EPA per rush, success rate, and yards per carry. Their passing offense also performed well, ranking in the top 15 in EPA per attempt, success rate, and yards per attempt.

The Eagles had three units that ranked in the top 10 in the league in 2022: pass offense, run offense, and pass defense. While their passing offense faced a relatively easier schedule of pass defenses, their pass defense also had the advantage of playing against easier pass offenses. However, the Eagles' run offense faced the 17th toughest schedule of run defenses, making their success on the ground even more impressive. Even against top-10 run defenses, the Eagles' rushing attack remained formidable, ranking highly in various metrics.

In 2022, Jalen Hurts showed significant improvement as the Philadelphia Eagles' starting quarterback. He led the team to an impressive 16-2 record in games he played, and if not for a late-season ankle injury, he would have been in the MVP conversation. Hurts completed 66.5% of his passes, ranking 11th in the league, and averaged 8.0 yards per attempt, placing him third overall. His interception rate was a mere 1.3%, which ranked fifth. Notably, Hurts has consistently improved his completion percentage, yards per attempt, and interception rate each year he has been in the NFL.

When evaluating his performance, Hurts finished sixth in expected points added (EPA) per play with 0.14, and he ranked eighth in EPA per dropback at 0.09. His passer rating of 101.5 placed him fourth among all qualified quarterbacks. As a testament to his progress, Hurts received a contract extension and the full commitment of the team during the offseason, solidifying his role as the Eagles' franchise quarterback.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, the Eagles can expect continued growth and success from Jalen Hurts. With his improved passing efficiency, combined with his mobility and playmaking ability, Hurts has the potential to be a dynamic force for the team. As he gains more experience and chemistry with his teammates, his impact on the Eagles' offense should only increase. The organization's commitment to Hurts suggests that they believe in his potential, and they will likely provide him with the necessary support and weapons to excel in the upcoming season.

In the 2022 season, the Philadelphia Eagles had success in their passing game, particularly through the efforts of wide receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. Brown, targeted 145 times, and Smith, targeted 136 times, were the primary playmakers, accounting for a significant portion of the team's targets, receptions, receiving yardage, and receiving touchdowns. Together, they combined for 55.6% of the team's targets, 52.3% of the receptions, 61.7% of the receiving yardage, and 72.0% of the receiving touchdowns. While the team has both wideouts under contract for multiple seasons, the depth behind them remains thin. On the bright side, the Eagles were highly efficient when targeting their tight ends, boasting a success rate of 66.7% in 2022. As they enter the 2023 season, the passing game will continue to rely on the talents of Brown, Smith, and tight end Dallas Goedert. Furthermore, the team added D'Andre Swift to their backfield, enhancing their options in terms of targets. Swift, who had an impressive yards per route run average of 1.65 in the previous year, brings another dynamic dimension to the Eagles' passing attack.

The Eagles can expect their passing game to continue revolving around the trio of A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, and Dallas Goedert. With their combined talent and chemistry, they will serve as the primary targets for quarterback Jalen Hurts. However, the team's depth beyond these three options remains a concern, and it will be important for other receivers and tight ends to step up and provide reliable contributions. Additionally, the addition of D'Andre Swift in the backfield presents another weapon in the passing game, giving Hurts another reliable target out of the backfield. The Eagles' success in the passing game will depend on the continued development and cohesion of their receiving corps, as well as their ability to exploit favorable matchups and create opportunities for big plays.

Philadelphia Eagles boasted the most efficient rushing offense in the NFL. They led the league in both expected points added (EPA) per rush and success rate per carry. Their rushing attack accumulated 2,509 yards (fifth) and scored 32 rushing touchdowns (first). Even when excluding the rushing contributions of quarterback Jalen Hurts, the Eagles still led the league in success rate and EPA per rush on carries by their running backs. While the team lost leading rusher Miles Sanders in free agency, they made notable additions to their backfield with Rashaad Penny and D'Andre Swift. Penny has been highly productive, ranking first in EPA per rush and leading all running backs in yards after contact per carry and overall yards per carry among those with 100 or more carries over the past two seasons. Swift, on the other hand, has displayed his efficiency by averaging 5.5 yards per touch throughout his career.

The 2023 season, the Eagles have the potential to maintain their strong rushing attack. With the addition of Rashaad Penny's explosiveness and D'Andre Swift's versatility, the team's backfield appears to be upgraded. The combination of Penny's impressive EPA per rush and Swift's ability to generate yards both on the ground and through the air provides the Eagles with a dynamic one-two punch. However, the success of the rushing offense will also rely on the offensive line's ability to create running lanes and the overall cohesion of the offense. If the Eagles can sustain their high success rate and efficiency on the ground, they should be able to continue their dominance in the rushing game in the upcoming season.

In terms of the Philadelphia Eagles' defense, they made some notable moves during the offseason to solidify their roster. Veteran defensive tackle Fletcher Cox was re-signed for another year after an impressive 2022 season where he recorded seven sacks. With Javon Hargrave departing, the Eagles will rely on their young interior linemen, including Jordan Davis and Jalen Carter, to take on larger roles. While Davis only played 20% of defensive snaps, he showcased his impact when on the field. Additionally, the Eagles bolstered their pass rush by utilizing more linebackers in that role. Their defense boasted an impressive 11.2% sack rate, the highest in the league, with Haason Reddick as a standout player who put up 16 sacks. Brandon Graham, who re-signed for a one-year deal, contributed 11 sacks in 2022. The emergence of Josh Sweat and the addition of Nolan Smith in the draft provide further depth and talent on the edge. However, the linebacker position took a hit with the departures of T.J. Edwards and Kyzir White in free agency. Rookie Nakobe Dean is now the team's top linebacker, and the Eagles also signed Nicholas Morrow as a veteran option.

In the secondary, the Eagles were able to retain one of the best cornerback duos in James Bradberry and Darius Slay. Bradberry, in his first year with the Eagles, ranked highly among outside corners in adjusted yards allowed per coverage snap and passes defensed. Slay also performed well, ranking fifth in adjusted yards allowed per coverage snap and 12th in passes defensed. Avonte Maddox adds depth and strength as a reliable slot corner. Additionally, the Eagles signed Greedy Williams, a former first-rounder, for high-upside depth at the cornerback position. Safety was another position affected by free agency departures, with C.J. Gardner-Johnson and Marcus Epps leaving the team. Philadelphia signed Terrell Edmunds to a one-year deal, hoping to tap into his potential as a former first-round pick.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, the Eagles' defense will depend on the continued performance and leadership of their core players, such as Cox, Reddick, Graham, Bradberry, and Slay. The development and contributions of young players like Davis, Carter, Sweat, and Dean will be crucial to the success of the defense. The team's ability to generate a strong pass rush with their linebacker-heavy approach will remain a focal point. The secondary, led by the talented cornerback duo, will aim to maintain their effectiveness in coverage. The Eagles will also rely on the experience of Morrow and the potential of Edmunds to provide stability and production at the linebacker and safety positions, respectively. With a mix of established veterans and promising young talent, the Eagles' defense has the potential to be a formidable unit in the 2023 season.

In the 2023 NFL Draft, the Philadelphia Eagles made several intriguing selections that addressed key positions of need while also taking some calculated risks. Jalen Carter, their first-round pick, possesses immense talent as an interior lineman, but concerns about his maturity and work ethic exist. With a pressure rate of 14.4% in college, ranking third among Power Five interior linemen, Carter has the potential to make an impact in the Eagles' defensive line rotation. Nolan Smith, another first-round pick, is seen as an insurance policy and potential long-term replacement for Haason Reddick. Despite being undersized, Smith demonstrated an impressive 20% pressure rate as an edge rusher in college, fitting well into the role created for Reddick by the previous coaching staff. Third-round pick Sydney Brown excelled as a strong safety in college but may need to adjust to a new role in the Eagles' defense, considering the recent signing of Terrell Edmunds. With his speed and athleticism, Brown has the potential to contribute as a versatile defensive back.

The Eagles also added depth and potential impact players in the later rounds of the draft. Kelee Ringo, their fourth-round pick, brings valuable traits to the secondary, showing promising results in defending both common and explosive routes in college. While he needs to refine his anticipation skills, Ringo's athleticism and coverage abilities make him an intriguing prospect. Tanner McKee, a surprise selection in the sixth round, provides depth at the quarterback position, showcasing a contrasting play style to Jalen Hurts. Although he comes from an offense with a mix of pro-style and slow-mesh concepts, McKee's potential as a developmental quarterback adds value to the Eagles' roster. Finally, Moro Ojomo, the seventh-round pick, adds depth to the defensive tackle position. Ojomo's athleticism and pressure-generating abilities in college make him a player to watch during training camp.

Howie Roseman's approach in the draft focused on selecting players who were considered the best available at the time, with a willingness to take calculated risks. While not all picks will pan out, this strategy aligns with the idea of accumulating talent and maximizing long-term success. The Eagles' draft class addresses key areas of need and provides depth and potential impact across the roster. As with any draft class, time will tell how these players develop and contribute to the team's success in the future.

Overall, the Philadelphia Eagles showcased a potent offense, particularly in the first half of games. Their emphasis on scoring inside the red zone, improved performance in goal-to-go situations, and the development of Jalen Hurts were key factors in their success. However, they experienced a drop-off in the second half and will look to address this in the upcoming season. Their elite rushing attack, even against tough run defenses, sets them apart and bodes well for their future prospects.
