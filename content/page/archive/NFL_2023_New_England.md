The 2022 season for the New England Patriots will be remembered as the Year of Matt Patricia. It was a challenging year for the team, particularly for their young first-round quarterback. The Patriots made several moves in the offseason, investing in free agent receivers and trading for others, with the intention of creating a safe environment for their young quarterback to develop. However, the decision to have Matt Patricia, known for his struggles as a coach, as the play-caller turned out to be a significant drawback for the team.

The season started off poorly, with the fan base turning against the young quarterback and calling for a rookie backup to take his place. The Patriots found themselves in a difficult position due to their past spending habits. Two years ago, they shocked the NFL by spending an NFL-high $291,246,000 in free agency. However, their record since then has been mediocre, with no playoff wins. As a result, the team scaled back their spending in the last two years, leading to the departure of key players.

In 2023, the Patriots made some modest moves in free agency, indicating that they recognize the need to support their quarterback, Mac Jones. Their biggest signing was JuJu Smith-Schuster, whom they signed for three years at market price. The Patriots understand the importance of evaluating Jones in his third year, especially after the struggles he faced under Patricia's play-calling. Patricia's track record as a play-caller over the past six years has been underwhelming, and his play-calling decisions severely impacted the offense's performance in 2022.

One of Patricia's major shortcomings was his failure to utilize play action effectively. The data showed that Jones performed significantly better with play action, but Patricia rarely called plays involving play action, using it at the lowest rate in the NFL. The difference in Jones' performance with and without play action was stark, with a night-and-day difference in his metrics. Despite the clear evidence, Patricia failed to adjust and continued to underutilize play action throughout the season.

Furthermore, Patricia's play-calling included a significant number of passes thrown behind the line of scrimmage, which proved to be inefficient for the offense. Jones' success rate and yards per attempt were much higher on passes beyond the line of scrimmage, indicating that the offense should have focused more on downfield passing. However, Patricia persisted with a high rate of short passes, limiting the team's offensive efficiency.

Patricia also mishandled Jones' return from injury, failing to properly prepare him and make effective play calls. The mismanagement resulted in poor performances and ultimately led to Jones being benched by the frustrated fan base. Patricia's inability to adapt and his questionable decision-making were evident throughout the season.

Looking ahead to the 2023 season, the Patriots will have a new offensive coordinator in Bill O'Brien. While this change brings hope for improvement, the team will face a challenging schedule, playing against some of the toughest pass defenses in the league. In 2022, the Patriots ranked poorly in quarterback EPA per play, success rate, and expected points added per dropback. Mac Jones, in particular, struggled in his second season, with lower completion rates, touchdown rates, and yards per pass attempt compared to his rookie year.

The receiving corps also faced challenges in 2022, with the team lacking production from their wideouts. Losing Jakobi Meyers in free agency and bringing in JuJu Smith-Schuster as a replacement may not result in significant improvement. The team will need Tyquan Thornton and DeVante Parker to step up their performances. Additionally, the addition of Mike Gesicki as a big slot receiver could provide a boost to the passing game.

The rushing game also struggled in 2022, ranking poorly in success rate, yards per carry, and expected points added per rush. Rhamondre Stevenson showed promise as a rookie, but the team will need more production from him and other running backs to improve the ground game.

On the defensive side, there were both positive and negative performances. Players like Davon Godchaux, Christian Barmore and Matthew Judon showed promise in their respective roles. However, there were issues with cornerback coverage, and the safety position will miss the presence of Devin McCourty, who retired. The Patriots will need their defensive unit to step up, especially against a tough schedule of offenses in 2023.

Overall, the Patriots faced numerous challenges in the 2022 season, primarily due to the questionable decisions and play-calling of Matt Patricia. The team will look to improve under the guidance of new offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien, but they will face a formidable schedule of defenses. The success of Mac Jones and the offense will depend on the improvement of the receiving corps and the ability to establish a more efficient rushing attack. Defensively, the Patriots will need their key players to continue performing at a high level and address the coverage issues in the secondary.
