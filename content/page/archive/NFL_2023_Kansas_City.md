The Kansas City Chiefs faced some challenges and concerns heading into the 2022 season that led to a lack of confidence from some observers. One major issue was the absence of star wide receiver Tyreek Hill. The team faced financial constraints due to quarterback Patrick Mahomes' significant cap hit, which made it challenging to retain key players while paying Hill. His dynamic playmaking ability was sorely missed, and people worried about how the offense would perform without him.

In 2021, the Chiefs' offense was not as explosive as in previous years. They ranked 19th in the league in producing explosive gains in the first three quarters of games, and opponents effectively used 2-high coverage shells to limit their passing attack. Mahomes' passing statistics suffered as he threw a higher percentage of passes behind the line of scrimmage, and his target depth on early downs decreased.

Mistakes and turnovers were harder for the Chiefs to overcome in 2021. They experienced more turnovers and struggled to score as efficiently as they had in previous seasons.

However, the outlook for the 2023 season improved significantly. In 2022, the Chiefs' explosive play rate and passing efficiency both increased, even without Tyreek Hill. They became more impervious to various defensive strategies and excelled in every aspect of their passing game. Mahomes' performance against 2-high defenses dramatically improved, making the offense even more formidable.

Despite their offensive prowess, the Chiefs' defense faced challenges. They devoted limited resources to their defense, which resulted in younger and less experienced players. In 2022, they played against easier offenses, but in 2023, they were set to face tougher opponents. Additionally, their tendency to play with light boxes made them vulnerable to the run and could be a concern, especially in the red zone.

Furthermore, the Chiefs' schedule in 2023 presented rest challenges. They had one of the worst net rest edges in the NFL, with six consecutive weeks of less rest than their opponents. This could test the team's depth and ability to stay healthy during crucial parts of the season.

Despite the challenges, the Chiefs had a high-powered offense led by Patrick Mahomes, who has consistently delivered outstanding performances. The team's ability to adjust to its personnel and maximize their strengths made them versatile and competitive. They were expected to continue being a top contender for the Super Bowl in 2023, and Mahomes' unprecedented success as a young quarterback added to the team's confidence.

In 2022, Patrick Mahomes once again showcased his brilliance, winning his second MVP award. He led the league in passing yards, touchdowns, and expected points added per dropback. Despite the absence of Tyreek Hill, Mahomes adapted to the situation, throwing more short and intermediate passes. His success rate was the highest of his career, and he proved to be the best player in the league. Looking ahead to 2023, Mahomes remains the driving force behind the Chiefs' passing game, and with his ability to adjust and perform at an elite level, the offense should continue to thrive.

Travis Kelce continued to be a force in the Chiefs' passing attack, setting career-highs in targets, catches, and touchdowns. The running backs also played a significant role in the receiving game, contributing to a high number of receptions and touchdowns. However, the wide receiver group lacked consistency and a true WR1 after Tyreek Hill's departure. The team is looking towards younger receivers like Kadarius Toney, Skyy Moore and Rashee Rice to step up and fill the void left by departures and free agency moves. The offense's success will depend on how well these young receivers develop and complement Kelce's productivity.

The Chiefs' rushing attack has been overshadowed by their passing game in recent years, and 2022 was no different. They ranked in the middle of the pack in rushing efficiency, but Isiah Pacheco showed promise when he became the primary ball carrier later in the season. The team retained Jerick McKinnon and has Clyde Edwards-Helaire in the final year of his rookie contract, providing depth and options in the backfield. The Chiefs may continue to prioritize the passing game, but if Pacheco continues to perform well, the rushing offense could become more significant in 2023.

Chiefs' defense showed moments of brilliance in 2022, especially with standout performances from Chris Jones and Khalen Saunders. The addition of George Karlaftis and Charles Omenihu should bolster their pass rush, providing more pressure on opposing quarterbacks. The linebacker unit, led by Nick Bolton and Willie Gay, has potential but needs to improve its consistency in coverage. In the secondary, L'Jarius Sneed and Trent McDuffie emerged as impactful players, and the addition of Justin Reid adds depth and versatility. The defense has the pieces to succeed, but it will need to address some inconsistencies and find the right personnel combinations to maximize its potential.

Kansas City focused on addressing immediate needs in the draft, particularly at edge rusher and wide receiver. Felix Anudike-Uzomah was added to provide pass-rushing help and replace Frank Clark. However, Anudike-Uzomah will need to translate his impressive athleticism into production to make a significant impact. Rashee Rice was drafted to help fill the void left by the departures of JuJu Smith-Schuster and Mecole Hardman. Rice's raw athleticism will be valuable, but he will need to improve his route-running to be successful at the NFL level. The Chiefs also drafted Wanya Morris to develop as an offensive tackle, potentially adding depth to their offensive line. Overall, the draft class has potential, but the Chiefs will need these young players to contribute quickly to support their Super Bowl aspirations.

Overall, the Chiefs had an impressive 2022 season, overcoming some early concerns and finding success with their dynamic offense. As they looked ahead to the 2023 season, the team was optimistic about their chances to compete for the Super Bowl title, although they would need to address defensive issues and navigate a challenging schedule to achieve their goals.
